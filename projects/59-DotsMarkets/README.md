# README for Dots Markets Hackathon Submission

## Dots Markets: PRC-20 Protocol and Dot Rune

### Project Overview

**Dots Markets** introduces **Dot Rune**, the pioneering Polkadot RUNE, and the innovative **PRC-20 protocol**, aiming to revolutionize the creation and management of digital assets on the Polkadot Network. By leveraging calldata for storage, the PRC-20 significantly boosts transaction efficiency while cutting costs associated with contract-based fungible tokens. Dot Rune offers a novel method for creating, sharing, and transferring digital assets, fostering a license-independent, censorship-resistant, and cost-effective environment. **DOTSMARKETS** is set to be the world's first inscription and rune cross-chain marketplace, facilitating seamless trades and transfers across various blockchain networks.

### Why PRC-20?
- **Community-Driven**: Revitalizing the Polkadot ecosystem through decentralized, non-profit initiatives.
- **Cost-Efficiency**: Empowering users with quick, secure rune minting and transfers at minimal costs.
- **Innovative**: Utilizing Polkadot's interoperability features for enhanced cross-chain interactions.

### Hackathon Contributions
During the hackathon, we focused on developing the minting and indexing functionalities for Dot Rune under the PRC-20 protocol, laying the groundwork for our future expansions and functionalities.

### Key Features
- **PRC-20 Protocol**: Uses calldata to store information, enhancing transaction efficiency and reducing costs.
- **Dot Rune**: An immutable on-chain representation of assets, ensuring traceability and verifiability.
- **Cross-chain Marketplace**: DOTSMARKETS enables trading and transferring of inscriptions and runes across different blockchain networks.

### Future Developments (Post-Hackathon)
- **PRC-631**: Targeting cross-chain interoperability to facilitate free circulation of inscriptions and runes beyond public blockchain barriers.
- **PRC-2321**: Planning to introduce financial functionalities to inscriptions and runes, enabling activities like borrowing, staking, and collateralization.
- **Indexing and Marketplace**: Aiming to provide easy access and trade for inscriptions and runes.
- **DEX**: Proposing a decentralized exchange for trading and liquidity.

### Governance and Community
Emphasizing a community-driven governance model, encouraging Dot Rune holders to actively engage in decision-making and protocol enhancements.

### Technical Specifications
During the hackathon, we developed:
- **Calldata Structure**: Optimized for efficient data storage and retrieval.
- **Minting and Transferring**: Procedures for creating and moving Dot Rune and other assets.
- **Transaction Formats**: Standardized formats for consistent and secure transactions.

### Roadmap
- **Nov. 2023**: Formation of the founding team.
- **Dec. 2023**: Launch of the first public version with Dot Rune minting, indexing, and marketplace functionalities.
- **Q1 2024**: Introduction of DEX and PRC-631 for cross-chain interoperability.
