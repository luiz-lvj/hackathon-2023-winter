description: An Overview of How you can Help Catch Bugs.
keywords: [bug, bug bounty, report]
slug: ../bug-bounty
---

If you discover a bug, we appreciate your cooperation in responsibly investigating and reporting it
as per [instructions on Web3 Foundation website](https://web3.foundation/security-report/).
Disclosure to any third parties disqualifies bug bounty eligibility.

:::info Bug bounty program scope

The bug bounty program does _not_ cover bugs on code bases that are external to or, written on top
of Polkadot, or that use Polkadot. To be eligible for the bug bounty program the bug has to be a
part of the Polkadot codebase, this includes protocols that Polkadot uses such as AnV, XCM, GRANDPA,
etc.

We call on our community and all bug bounty hunters to help identify bugs in Polkadot.

:::

## Eligibility

Generally speaking, any bug that poses a significant vulnerability, either to the soundness of
protocols and protocol/implementation compliance to network security, to classical client security,
as well as security of cryptographic primitives, could be eligible for a reward. Please note that
it's entirely our discretion to decide whether a bug is significant enough to qualify for a reward.

:::note

The submission quality will be a significant factor in the level of considered compensation. A
high-quality submission includes explaining how the bug can be reproduced, how it was discovered,
and otherwise critical details. Please disclose responsibly; disclosure to any third parties
disqualifies bug bounty eligibility.

Examples:

- An attack that could disrupt the entire network and harm the validity to the network would be
  considered a critical threat.
- An attack that would disrupt service to others would be regarded as a high threat.

:::

:::tip Responsible investigation and reporting

Responsible investigation and reporting include, but isn't limited to, the following:

- Don't violate the privacy of other users, destroy data, etc.
- Don't defraud or harm Polkadot network or its users during your research; you should make a good
  faith effort not to interrupt or degrade our services.
- Don't target the validators' physical security measures, or attempt to use social engineering,
  spam, distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks, etc.
- Initially, report the bug only to us and not to anyone else.
- Give us a reasonable amount of time to fix the bug before disclosing it to anyone else, and give
  us adequate written warning before disclosing it to anyone else.
- In general, please investigate and report bugs in a way that makes a reasonable, good-faith effort
  not to be disruptive or harmful to our users or us. Otherwise, your actions might be interpreted
  as an attack rather than an effort to be helpful.

sidebar_label: Substrate Builders
description: The Substrate Builders Program and How it can Support your Substrate Development.
slug: ../builders-program
---

Over 150 projects are using [Substrate](https://substrate.io) to create the next generation of
blockchain infrastructure and application-specific chains.

The [Substrate Builders Program](https://substrate.io/ecosystem/substrate-builders-program/) is an
initiative by Parity Technologies to take your [Substrate](https://substrate.io) project to the next
level.

Projects building Substrate-based blockchains, applications, or ecosystem components can receive
support for technical challenges, strategy, and ecosystem building from Parity’s extensive
experience and resources.

## Square One Initiative

The [Square One initiative](https://substrate.io/ecosystem/square-one/) is a step behind the
Substrate Builders Program as it helps early-stage teams who are committed to building on
{{ polkadot: polkadot :polkadot }}{{ kusama: kusama :kusama }} find their feet in the ecosystem.

Square One's primary purpose as a program is to help tailor a specific pathway across our Substrate
resources that act as a lighthouse for new and early-stage projects, developers & builders that are
committed to building on Polkadot.

The objective of Square One is threefold:

- To accelerate the development of teams in the Polkadot ecosystem.
- Identify needs & blockers that teams face and address them accordingly in the most efficient
  manner.
- Create a dedicated pathway for each team based on their needs and track them accordingly.

There are many ways to build on Substrate, and the ecosystem comprises numerous toolkits and
resources for education, development, and funding. The initiative guides teams down the most
appropriate path of tools and support resources, enabling them to accomplish their goals and launch
new products with minimum friction.

The resources available through Square One can be grouped into various categories:

- **Funding** - Apply for grants, including access to education and support on how to access funding
  through the Polkadot Treasury and the Web3 Foundation Grants Program, Accelerators & VCs.

- **Education** - Gain recognized certifications, join Hackathons, apply for the Polkadot Blockchain
  Academy to expand one’s programming expertise to develop a project’s POC/MVP.

- **Tech mentoring** - Access mentorship groups to help make your development market fit.

- **Product development** - Get directed towards external parties interested in Substrate
  development projects.

- **Development support** - Completely bespoke development resources are available to aid the
  project development and growth.

## Tracks

There are three tracks builders can take for the program.

### Chains track

This track supports builders who are building application-specific chains, which include parachains,
parathreads and independent chains too.

### Infrastructure track

This track supports builders who are building ecosystem-based infrastructure, which may be in the
form of tooling, UI, middleware, bridges, and more.

### Application track

This track supports builders who are building on top of Substrate-based chains.

Check out the official
[Substrate Builders Program](https://substrate.io/ecosystem/substrate-builders-program/) site for
more information and steps on how to apply.

id: decentralized-futures
title: Decentralized Futures Programme
sidebar_label: Decentralized Futures
description: Learn about the Decentralized Futures Program.
keywords: [community, ecosystem, funding]
slug: ../decentralized-futures
---

The new [Decentralized Futures Program](https://futures.web3.foundation/) supplements the Grants
Program, and (as the name suggests) it strengthens the decentralization of the Polkadot ecosystem.

## Overview

This program is set to distribute **20 million USD and 5 million DOT tokens** to support individuals
and teams as they launch new initiatives to grow the Polkadot ecosystem. The main objective is to
expand the network by adding self-sustaining participants. Funding is available for Polkadot-focused
organizations aim to generate profit and for non-profit ventures that have a strategy to secure
ongoing financing through Polkadot's on-chain treasury system beyond 2024.

The Program is run by the Web3 Foundation, which is a not-for-profit organization that supports Web3
teams and open-source projects through funding, advocacy, research, and collaboration.

## Program Goal

The goal of the Decentralized Futures Program is to kickstart economically independent, active
participants in the Polkadot ecosystem.

## Applications

To apply for funding to the Decentralized Futures fill
[**this form**](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdlPyHj56tY6t-5zhdn55VvznR5OACvXe8K1M6vRGmhdslZkw/viewform).
The form will guide you through each step of the application. You are also encouraged to post the
idea in the [**Polkadot forum**](https://forum.polkadot.network/) upfront. If you have any
questions, you can reach out to the the
[**W3F Decentralized Futures Community on Element**](https://matrix.to/#/#df:web3.foundation).

Proposals have to be **submitted before July 1st, 2024**. Applications will be **reviewed from Dec
1st, 2023 - Jul 31st, 2024** on a rolling basis.

## Selection Criteria

In the current phase, we intentionally maintain openness in our approach. This deliberate choice
stems from recognizing that specific initiatives demand substantial and bold efforts, often
incurring significant costs, particularly in areas where traditional go-to-market functions are no
longer in play. Conversely, there are instances where individuals require relatively modest funding
in the tens of thousands to initiate their projects. This broad approach avoids constraining
people's creativity and allows for many possibilities. However, it does come with the drawback of
prolonged application processing times.

Several factors significantly enhance the likelihood of application success:

- A well-thought-out and compelling plan outlining the project’s sustainability beyond 2024 is
  crucial. While injecting funds into the ecosystem is straightforward, convincing customers or the
  community of the value behind that financial investment poses a more substantial challenge.
- Applicants are encouraged to provide a detailed breakdown of how the requested funds will be
  utilized, with granularity increasing proportionally with the amount sought. This meticulous
  approach ensures transparency and accountability in the allocation of resources.
- A demonstrated willingness to receive a more significant portion of the value in long-term DOT
  rather than immediate FIAT, aligning with the broader ecosystem's goals.

:::info Sign up

Use [this form](https://info.polkadot.network/polkadot-developer-heroes?ref=cms.polkadot.network) to
sign up and become a candidate for the Polkadot Developer Heroes Program.

:::

## Goal

Build a strong community of Polkadot developers of different levels of expertise to drive the growth
and evolution of the Polkadot ecosystem. Developers need to have some degree of experience with the
Polkadot technology stack.

The program provides:

- Opportunities for personal and professional growth.
- Resources and support to boost the growth and evolution of developers.
- Chance to showcase and enhance skills.
- Establish yourself as a valued contributor to the Polkadot ecosystem and pull someone else up on
  stage at the same time. Each one, teach one!

## Rookies and Heroes

A rookie is a beginner or first-timer developer. Someone who has previous experience in programming
but needs to gain in-depth knowledge about the Polkadot technology.

The technology includes but is not limited to independent [Substrate](./glossary.md#substrate)
chains and [ink! development](../build/build-smart-contracts.md#ink), and Polkadot-related tooling.
Rookies will need to learn these concepts and tools so that they can deliver the tasks required to
be a Hero.

A rookie becomes a hero by continuously advocating for the technology used in the Polkadot ecosystem
as well as spreading awareness and educating a broader audience about the technology.

Depending on what you enjoy doing, you can become a hero by doing some of the following things:

- **Offer mentoring**: Offer 1:1 or group mentoring to fellow community members.

- **Help out in the community forums**: Answer questions from the community on the
  [Substrate and Polkadot StackExchange](https://substrate.stackexchange.com/?ref=cms.polkadot.network)
  or on the [Polkadot Forum](https://forum.polkadot.network/?ref=cms.polkadot.network).

- **Contribute to the Polkadot stack**: Have a look at the
  [open source technology stack list](../build/build-open-source.md) and contribute with a pull
  request, an issue, or find and fix bugs.

- **Create content**: Write a blog post, record a video tutorial, and write a Twitter thread. Share
  about your latest coding success, something you learned and are excited about.

- **Speak at events**: Do a workshop or talk at meetups and conferences.

of Authority (PoA) network, with governance controlled by the single Sudo (super-user) account.
During this time, validators started joining the network and signaling their intention to
participate in consensus.

The network evolved to become a Proof of Stake (PoS) network on June 18, 2020. With the chain
secured by the decentralized community of validators, the Sudo module was removed on July 20, 2020,
transitioning the governance of the chain into the hands of the token (DOT) holders. This is the
point where Polkadot became decentralized.

The final step of the transition to full-functioning Polkadot was the enabling of transfer
functionality, which occurred on Polkadot at block number 1_205_128 on August 18, 2020, at 16:39
UTC.

On August 21, 2020, Redenomination of DOT occurred. From this date, one DOT (old) equals 100 new
DOT.

[official Polkadot website](https://polkadot.network/technology/#roadmap).

## Validators

### How do I apply to be a validator?

There is no central authority that decides on validators, so there is not per se an _application_
that you can fill out. Registering as a validator is permissionless; in order to become one you must
only set up a validator node and mark your intention to validate on chain. For detailed instruction
on how to do this you can consult the
[Kusama validator guide](../maintain/kusama/maintain-guides-how-to-validate-kusama.md) on validating
for Kusama or the
[Polkadot validator guide](../maintain/maintain-guides-how-to-validate-polkadot.md) for validating
on Polkadot.

However, once you've set up a validator and have registered your intention it does not mean that you
will be included in the _active set_ right away. The validators are elected to the active set based
on the results of an election algorithm known as [Phragmén's method](../learn/learn-phragmen.md).
Phragmén's method tries to accomplish two goals: 1) select `n` members from a larger set based on
stake-weighted votes and 2) equalize the stake backing each validator as much as possible.

You will likely want to campaign your validator to the community in order to get more backing. You
are looking for _nominators_ that will put up their tokens to increase the stake for your validator.
For validators who cannot acquire the minimum stake from the community, Parity and Web3 Foundation
also run a joint program called [Thousand Validators](thousand-validators.md) that will nominate
validators if they apply and fit the requirements.

### How are validators rewarded?

Validators are rewarded from the inflation of the Relay Chain, transaction fees, and tips. However,
they only take a percentage of the former two. More details can be read on the page for
[validator payouts](../maintain/maintain-guides-validator-payout.md).

### What is the minimum stake necessary to be elected as an active validator?

The minimum stake that is necessary to be elected as an active validator is dynamic and can change
over time. It depends not only on how much stake is being put behind each validator, but also the
size of the active set and how many validators are waiting in the pool.

There are a few ways to estimate the minimum stake.

One way can be to navigate to the
[Polkadot Apps Targets tab](https://ipfs.io/ipns/polkadot.dotapps.io/#/staking/targets). The value
at the top of the screen saying "Lowest" is the least staked validator. You need at least this
much + 1 to enter the set.

You can also use some tools some to perform estimations.

- [Offline Election](https://github.com/paritytech/substrate-debug-kit/tree/master/offline-election)
  can provide exact results of running an election on the current set of validators using the same
  Rust code that is ran in Polkadot.

- [Validator stats script](https://github.com/w3f/validator-stats) can give you an estimate that is
  based on the currently elected set, as well as some statistics about Kusama validators.

### Why will Polkadot have only 1000 validators while other projects have hundreds of thousands?

Polkadot's goal to have 1000 validators is set to be something that is practically achievable in the
short term with high confidence of good performance in a live environment. Furthermore, validators
in Polkadot are not the only stakers, and if we consider the number of stakers that can be possible
on Polkadot the number can scale up to hundreds of thousands. Since validators are performing
critical consensus work to maintain the security of the chain including all of its shards, a more
modest number of validators is estimated to start. Upon later improvements, such as implementing
signature aggregation for finalization messages, the number of validators could reasonably scale up.
However, increasing validators above one thousand remains a goal for later iterations of Polkadot.

It is also worth mentioning that one thousand validators is more than the number of validators of
similar PoS chains with comparable levels of economic security as Polkadot. The closest contenders
are operating with around 150 validators, while Polkadot is already securely running with
{{ polkadot: <RPC network="polkadot" path="query.staking.validatorCount" defaultValue={297}/> :polkadot }}
{{ kusama: <RPC network="polkadot" path="query.staking.validatorCount" defaultValue={297}/> :kusama }}
validators.

Additionally, other projects sometimes have a different definition of _validator_ that approximates
more closely to remote signing keys without the full operation of a validating node. On Polkadot,
each validator is running their own validating node and performing full verification of the Relay
Chain, voting on finality, producing blocks in their decided slots, and verifying parachain state
transitions. Other projects may consider validators and "validating nodes" as separate entities.

Finally, individuals may participate in the block production process indirectly by
[nominating](../learn/learn-nominator.md) validators. In this way, individuals who are not running a
node can still share in staking rewards.

## Relay Chain

### What is the block time of the Relay Chain?

Both the Kusama and Polkadot networks are currently operating at a rate of one block every six
seconds.

This may be changed in the future. It may go as low as two to three seconds after optimizations, or
potentially increase in order to handle the capacity of the parachain networking in a live
environment.

### Does Polkadot have smart contracts?

No - and yes. The Polkadot Relay Chain does not implement smart contracts natively. The reason for
not having smart contracts on the Relay Chain is part of the design philosophy for Polkadot that
dictates that the Relay Chain should be the minimal logic required to accomplish its job.

However, Polkadot will be a platform for other chains that _do_ implement smart contracts. It's
possible for parachains to enable smart contract functionality and then benefit from the security
and interoperability features of Polkadot. Additionally, existing smart contract chains can connect
to Polkadot as a parachain, or via a bridge.

While the Polkadot Relay Chain does not implement smart contracts directly, undoubtedly there will
be parachains that do. So it's better to say that the Polkadot _ecosystem_ has smart contracts
versus "Polkadot has smart contracts."

### How will the Polkadot Relay Chain connect to external chains in the ecosystem?

One of the cornerstone interoperability technologies being researched and developed for deployment
on Polkadot is cross-chain bridges. Bridges come in a variety of flavors with varying levels of
trust associated with them. Polkadot is predominantly researching the trust-minimized flavor that
imposes economic costs on the operators of the bridge, and therefore makes it economically secure.
Bridge efforts are being worked on in concert with other projects in the ecosystem. Eventually,
there will be bridges between Polkadot and most of the other major chains.

### What is Polkadot's Transactions Per Second (TPS)?

Polkadot is a heterogeneous sharded network comprising a relay chain and numerous parachains, which
are all individual blockchains built on [Substrate](https://substrate.io/) executing in parallel.
Hence, the Transactions Per Second (TPS) of Polkadot is a number that encompasses all the
transactions on the relay chain as well as parachains. As the transactions on these Substrate-based
blockchains are [weights based](https://docs.substrate.io/build/tx-weights-fees/), it makes sense to
use TPS as a measure for the network performance if all the transactions carry the same weight.
[Performance benchmark tests](https://twitter.com/gavofyork/status/1270025498580656134) show that
Substrate-based blockchains can achieve over 1000 TPS for balance transfer transactions. Assuming
Polkadot is running over 100 parachains; the projected TPS is well over 100,000. With
[asynchronous backing upgrade](../learn/learn-async-backing.md), the TPS is expected to increase
tenfold to 1,000,000.

It is essential to realize that TPS is inherently a subjective measurement with numerous factors
that can contribute to it. It's hard to gauge the usefulness of TPS in isolation (when compared to
other chains), as it depends on what a transaction does for a particular network. To view how
Polkadot measures TPS see the Polkadot sTPS
([Standard Transaction Per Second](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-stps/blob/main/docs/introduction.md))
to consider precisely how benchmarking was performed for Polkadot.

## DOT

### What is the difference between DOT (old) and new DOT?

The DOT (old) unit on Polkadot was at twelve decimal places, otherwise known as 1e12 Plancks. On 21
August, 2020, Denomination Day, the DOT (old) value was redenominated to 1e10 (10_000_000_000, or
ten billion) Plancks, meaning that the new DOT was valued at ten decimal places. Following the
[redenomination](../learn/learn-redenomination.md), the new DOT is called DOT.

### What is the inflation rate of the DOT?

The inflation rate is approximately 10% per year.

A portion of the inflation is rewarded to validators for performing their duties, while another
portion may go directly to the treasury. The exact percentage that goes into both varies and is
based on the amount of DOT that are staked. Please see the article on
[inflation](../learn/learn-staking.md/#inflation) for more information.

### Why can't crowdloaned DOT be staked?

DOTs contributed to a successful crowdloan campaign by a parachain are bonded for the entire lease
period, which is two years on Polkadot. The crowdloaned DOT cannot be used for any other DOT utility
functionalities like staking and democracy. In exchange to the lost staking rewards or liquidity of
DOTs, the parachain team may offer rewards to the contributor.

The utility of crowdloaned DOT is to provide a lease for a parachain. The utility of staked DOT is
to secure the network through a reward/slash mechanism. Allowing crowdloaned DOT to be staked
results in complex consequences like applying a slash on crowdloaned DOT that was meant to be bonded
for the entire lease period of a parachain. In a way, the inaccessibility of crowdloaned DOTs and
the lack of staking rewards for the entire lease duration encourages the contributors to back
projects that are valuable to the ecosystem.

## Governance

### What prevents Polkadot governance from failing?

Polkadot's governance has already been shown to work. Examples can be found in the runtime upgrades
that have successfully taken place through on the testnets as well as in a real economic environment
on [Kusama](https://guide.kusama.network) and Polkadot itself.

It is fair to say that the field of on-chain blockchain governance is still new, and no one can
claim to know exactly what the optimal version of on-chain governance is yet. However, Polkadot
takes a brave step forward in pioneering thought-through mechanisms for evolving a blockchain.

Blockchains need a method to adapt and evolve. Therefore, an on-chain governance system was
necessary for the long-term success of Polkadot. Ultimately, it is the token holders that are
responsible for preventing Polkadot's governance from failing by using their economic value and
conviction to sway the progression of the protocol.

### What prevents Polkadot governance from becoming plutocratic?

A savvy reader might have noticed that the answer to the previous question endowed the token holder
with the ultimate responsibility to ensure that Polkadot's governance does not fail. By following
the train of this assertion, one might assume that Polkadot's governance is susceptible to becoming
ruled by a few large token holders (called _whales_ in trading parlance) and therefore become a mere
plutocracy (rule of the rich).

There are several other mechanisms that are built-in to the governance system to resist this
plutocratic tendency. One of these mechanisms is called conviction voting, and imbues greater voting
power to token holders who are willing to lock their tokens on the protocol for longer lengths of
time. Longer lock-ups display _conviction_ in a vote. Conviction voting could allow a highly
determined minority to overrule the vote of an apathetic majority in certain situations. Another
mechanism is known as Adaptive Quorum Biasing. This makes proposals have a varying threshold for
approval or rejection based on what part of the governance protocol the proposal originated in. For
details on the subtleties of Polkadot's governance system, please see the
[governance page](../learn/learn-governance.md).

## Parachains

### How do parachain economics work?

Parachains have the flexibility to implement their own monetary system or incentive structure for
collators. However, this is not strictly necessary. Since the collator's job is to continue to give
recent state transitions to the validators on the Relay Chain who validate each transition, the
security of the parachain and the Polkadot network is completely separate from parachain economics.
Parachains need collators to continue to progress, so it wouldn't be unreasonable to see them
incentivize collator nodes in some way, but the specific mechanism is completely up to parachain
implementers.

### Are parachains ephemeral? What happens when a parachain loses the next auction?

Parachains are not ephemeral. As long as someone is keeping the data for a parachain, the parachain
can move between being a parachain, a parathread, or a separate sovereign chain at different points
of its lifetime. Especially with parathreads, parachains can be decommissioned to only produce
blocks when their usage and throughput makes it necessary.

When a parachain loses an auction for renewal, that parachain has a few options. In most cases,
becoming a parathread instead would be a suitable choice. Parathreads are still secured by the Relay
Chain, but don't need to hold a parachain slot and can produce a block when its economically
feasible for them. For more on parachains please see the
[parachains page](../learn/learn-parachains.md) and for more on parathreads see
[the parathreads page](../learn/learn-parathreads.md).

## Networking

### What is libp2p?

[Libp2p](https://libp2p.io) is a modular and extensible networking stack that is used by IPFS,
Substrate, and many other projects. It is a collection of peer-to-peer protocols for finding peers
and connecting to them. Its modules have logic for content routing, peer routing, peer discovery,
different transports, and NAT traversals. It is intended to be used by applications for building
large scale peer-to-peer networks by only selecting the parts of the protocol suite that are needed.

The Rust implementation of the specification was built and primarily maintained by a team of
contributors at Parity Technologies. The Go and JavaScript versions are maintained by Protocol Labs
as well as community contributors. A [Nim](https://github.com/status-im/nim-libp2p) version of the
library also exists. Libp2p as a whole is an open source project that is actively developed and
expanded on various code repositories hosted on [their GitHub](https://github.com/libp2p).

### Does Polkadot use libp2p?

Yes, since Polkadot is built with Substrate. Substrate uses a networking protocol that is based on
libp2p (specifically the Rust libp2p library). However, Substrate uses a mix of standard libp2p
protocols and protocols that are homegrown and not official libp2p standards. Of the standards
protocols, those which are shared with other implementations of libp2p such as IPFS, are
connection-checking (ping), asking for information on a peer (identity), and Kademlia random walks
(kad).

Of the protocols that are custom to Substrate, there are the legacy Substrate stream, a
request-response for getting information on blocks (sync), a light client protocol, a notification
protocol for transactions, and block announcement. For detailed information on how Substrate uses
libp2p and the standard and custom protocols, please see the
[networking documentation](https://paritytech.github.io/substrate/master/sc_network/index.html).

### How does libp2p differ from IPFS?

The [Interplanetary File System](https://ipfs.io/) (IPFS) is a peer-to-peer hypermedia protocol used
primarily for storage of files. It allows one to upload a file onto the network and share it with
its content addressable URI. IPFS, like Substrate, is an application of libp2p and exists higher on
the technology stack. Although both IPFS and Substrate use libp2p, it cannot be said that Substrate
"uses" IPFS since besides sharing the underlying library for networking there is no native
integration between the two applications.

## Kusama

### What is the minimum amount of KSM / DOT I can have in my account?

Please see information about [Existential Deposits](../build/build-protocol-info.md).

### What are the transfer fees for Kusama?

It is important to note that the cost of transferring KSM is dynamic. Currently, the minimum cost of
transferring KSM is 0.01 KSM (the base fee), although this can be changed via governance. However,
actual transaction fees will vary based on a variety of factors. Specifically, fee calculation
follows the following formula:

```
base_fee + (tx_length * length_fee) + WeightToFee(weight)
```

Please see the
[fee calculation](https://docs.substrate.io/reference/how-to-guides/weights/calculate-fees/) page in
the Substrate documentation for more detailed information.

## What is Polkadot?

Polkadot is the first layer-0 (L0) blockchain that provides shared security and secure
interoperability to layer-1 (L1) blockchains. Those L1 blockchain attached to Polkadot are also
called [parachains](../learn/learn-parachains.md) as their transactions are processed in parallel by
Polkadot. For more information about Polkadot see the dedicated page about the state of
[Polkadot 1.0](./polkadot-v1.md) released in mid 2023.

Polkadot has an on-chain [open governance](../learn/learn-polkadot-opengov.md) (also called Polkadot
OpenGov) to orchestrate decisions, including accessing funds from the
[treasury](../learn/learn-polkadot-opengov-treasury.md).

The [DOT token](../learn/learn-DOT.md) gives you the power to participate in Polkadot OpenGov,
[staking](../learn/learn-staking.md), and [parachains' crowdloans](../learn/learn-crowdloans.md).

The level of abstraction and generalization of Polkadot allows to build applications that are
specific to their use cases, and for those applications to communicate securely leveraging each
other value proposition. The trustless cooperation between applications is what makes Polkadot an
ideal ecosystem to build a [web3 future](./web3-and-polkadot.md).

See the videos below to know more about Polkadot.

## What can I do with my DOT?

[DOT](../learn/learn-DOT.md) is the native token of the Polkadot Network. DOT can be used for
transaction fees, staking, governance, acquisition of a parachain slot and for enabling several key
functionalities on Polkadot.

## Why should you use Polkadot?

Whether you're a blockchain developer or if you're interested in taking part of
[Polkadot's community](https://polkadot.network/polkadot-ambassador-program/), Polkadot offers a
platform for everyone. This wiki offers a place for builders and maintainers to utilize
[tools](../build/build-tools-index.md) and for brand-new learners to dive into educational material.

## Where to start learning?

The
[Blockchain Fundamentals MOOC course](https://mooc.web3.foundation/course/blockchain-fundamentals/)
is a great introduction to start familiarizing yourself with blockchain concepts such as
cryptography and networks, and how these play into things like decentralization and cryptocurrency.

This is recommended for users with backgrounds of all levels, and the course is free!

### Brand-New Polkadot learners

- [Polkadot's original white paper](https://polkadot.network/PolkaDotPaper.pdf) is a technical
  summary around one possible direction of implementing the Polkadot network. This paper uses
  rationale and technical details to support why this direction is beneficial. This original white
  paper also explains how Polkadot's core components work together to build this decentralized
  network.
- [Polkadot's overview paper](https://github.com/w3f/research/blob/master/docs/papers/OverviewPaper-V1.pdf)
  is an updated version of the white paper that describes the protocol in more technical terms. We
  would recommend reading this overview paper if you are interested in digging more into the
  protocol itself.
- [Polkadot's light paper](https://polkadot.network/Polkadot-lightpaper.pdf) is a visual, easy to
  read, and less technical introduction into its blockchain technology. This paper dives into the
  components of Polkadot but is understandable for both a non-technical and technical reader.
- [Polkadot for Beginners: A non-technical guide to decentralization, blockchains & Polkadot](https://linktr.ee/polkadotbook) -
  a book funded by the Polkadot Treasury
- [Polkadot's specification](https://github.com/w3f/polkadot-spec) is a GitHub repository that holds
  the latest Polkadot Host protocol specification, Polkadot's specification tests of the many
  components of the network, and the Polkadot Runtime specification. This repo holds algorithms and
  explores how various processes function in the Polkadot network. The Polkadot specification takes
  Polkadot's ideas and concepts from the light and the white paper but focuses on the technical
  specs of the technology.
- [Watching the Technical Explainer Videos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNStMPZjiHM&list=PLOyWqupZ-WGuAuS00rK-pebTMAOxW41W8):
  These are great introductory videos that explain and demonstrate how to use Polkadot and its
  [User Interface](https://polkadot.js.org/apps/).
- Reading
  [What is Polkadot? A Brief Introduction](https://medium.com/polkadot-network/what-is-polkadot-a-brief-introduction-ca3eac9ddca5)
  on Medium. There are also other great articles to read on
  [Polkadot's Medium](https://medium.com/polkadot-network) or
  [Web3 Foundation's Medium](https://medium.com/web3foundation).
- [Polkadot Study](https://polkadot.study/) is a platform where developers can write tutorials for
  the Polkadot ecosystem. Part of the development of the platform was funded by the
  [Kusama treasury](https://kusama.subsquare.io/referenda/102). The platform also hosts
  [Substrate in Bits](https://polkadot.study/tutorials/substrate-in-bits/), a technical content
  series aimed at solving the pain points of developers building with
  [Substrate](https://substrate.io/) and [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/).

import RPC from "./../../components/RPC-Connection";

## Active Nomination

A validator (or validators) that a nominator has selected to nominate and is actively validating
this era. The nominator is placing their stake behind this validator for this era and will
potentially receive staking rewards in return for doing so.

## Alexander

The fourth (now defunct) proof of concept (PoC-4) [testnet](#testnet) for Polkadot.

## Asset Hub

A system parachain used for asset management.

## Attestation

In the {{ polkadot: Polkadot :polkadot }}{{ kusama: Kusama :kusama }} validity system, an
_attestation_ is a type of message that validators broadcast that says whether they think a
parachain candidate block is valid or invalid.

## Auction (Parachain)

Parachain auctions are how non-common-good parathreads win a slot to become a parachain.

## Aura

Authority-based round-robin scheduling (AURA) provides a slot-based block authoring mechanism, where
a known set of authorities take turns producing blocks.

## Authority

An authority is a generic term for the role in a blockchain that can participate in the consensus
mechanisms. In [GRANDPA](#grandpa-finality-gadget), the authorities vote on chains they consider
final. In BABE, the authorities are block producers. Authority sets can be chosen to be mechanisms
such as {{ polkadot: Polkadot :polkadot }}{{ kusama: Kusama :kusama }}'s NPoS algorithm.

## Availability Cores

Slots used to process parachains. The runtime assigns each parachain to an availability core and
validators can fetch information about the cores, such as parachain block candidates, by calling the
appropriate Runtime API.

## BABE

Blind Assignment for Blockchain Extension (BABE) is
{{ polkadot: Polkadot :polkadot }}{{ kusama: Kusama :kusama }}'s block production mechanism.

## Bitfield Array

A bitfield array contains single-bit values which indicate whether a [candidate](#candidate) is
available. The number of items is equal of to the number of
[availability cores](#availability-cores) and each bit represents a vote on the corresponding core
in the given order.

## Block

A collection of data, such as transactions, that together indicate a state transition of the
blockchain.

## Blockspace

[Blockspace](https://polkadot.network/blog/blockspace-blockspace-ecosystems-how-polkadot-is-unlocking-the-full-potential-of-web3)
is the capacity of a blockchain to finalize and commit operations. It represents a blockchain's
security, computing, and storage capability as an end product. Blockspace produced by different
blockchains can vary in quality, availability, and flexibility. Polkadot has a
[blockspace-centric architecture](https://www.rob.tech/blog/polkadot-blockspace-over-blockchains/).

## Block Explorer

An application that allows a user to explore the different blocks on a blockchain.

## Blocks Nominations

This indicates that a validator does not currently allow any more nominations. This is controlled by
the validator.

## BLS

Boneh-Lynn-Shacham (BLS) signatures have a slow signing, very slow verification, require slow and
much less secure pairing friendly curves, and tend towards dangerous malleability. Yet, BLS permits
a diverse array of signature aggregation options far beyond any other known signature scheme, which
makes BLS a preferred scheme for voting in consensus algorithms and threshold signatures.

## Bonding

A process by which tokens can be "frozen" in exchange for some other benefit. For example, staking
is a form of bonding for which you receive rewards in exchange for securing the network. You can
also bond tokens in exchange for a parachain slot.

## Bounty

A mechanism which works in some sense as the reverse of a Treasury Proposal, allowing the
{{ polkadot: Polkadot :polkadot }}{{ kusama: Kusama :kusama }} Council to indicate that there is a
need to do some task for the {{ polkadot: Polkadot :polkadot }}{{ kusama: Kusama :kusama }} network
and allowing users to receive DOT in return for working on that task.

## Bridge

A parachain that acts as an intermediary between the
{{ polkadot: Polkadot :polkadot }}{{ kusama: Kusama :kusama }} Relay Chain and an external chain, in
such a way that it appears to the Relay Chain that the external chain is a parachain (i.e., meets
the {{ polkadot: Polkadot :polkadot }}{{ kusama: Kusama :kusama }} Host's requirements of
parachains). Bridges allow for interaction between other blockchains, such as Ethereum and Bitcoin,
that are not natively compatible with
{{ polkadot: Polkadot :polkadot }}{{ kusama: Kusama :kusama }}.

## Byzantine Fault Tolerance

The property of a system that is tolerant of Byzantine faults; a system where not only may
individual subsystems fail, but it may not be clear if a particular subsystem has failed or not.
That is, different observers on the system may not agree on whether or not the system has failed.
Ensuring Byzantine fault tolerance is an important part of developing any distributed system.

## Capacity

The maximum number of nominators signalling intent to nominate a validator (and thus could
potentially actively nominate that validator in the next session). This maximum number will equal
the number of nominators necessary to oversubscribe a validator. Any validator which is "at
capacity" or higher may potentially be oversubscribed in the next session; a validator that is not
at capacity cannot be oversubscribed unless more nominators select it before the next election.

## Candidate

A candidate is a submitted parachain block to the relay chain validators. A parachain block stops
being referred to as a candidate as soon it has been finalized.

## Collations

Parachain blocks or candidates that are being proposed to the
{{ polkadot: Polkadot :polkadot }}{{ kusama: Kusama :kusama }} relay chain validators. More
specifically, a collation is a [data structure](https://spec.polkadot.network/#defn-collation) which
contains the proposed parachain candidate, including an optional validation parachain Runtime update
and upward messages.

## Collator

A node that maintains a parachain by collecting parachain transactions and producing state
transition proofs for the validators.

## Collectives

The Polkadot Collectives parachain was added in
[Referendum 81](https://polkadot.polkassembly.io/referendum/81) and exists only on Polkadot (i.e.,
there is no Kusama equivalent). The Collectives chain hosts on-chain collectives that serve the
Polkadot network, such as the [Fellowship](#fellowship) and [Polkadot Alliance](#polkadot-alliance).

## Commission

Validators and nominators get paid from block production on the network, where validators can set a
variable commission rate, which is initially subtracted from the total rewards that validator is
entitled to (for that period), where the commission determines the rate of distribution for the
remaining rewards set out for the nominators that are backing that validator.

## Common Good (Parachain)

See [System Parachains](#system-parachains), which is generally preferred over the term "common
good".

## Community Queue

The queue for proposals originating from individual accounts (i.e. not the Council) which are
waiting to become referenda. Compare the External queue.

## Consensus

The process of a group of entities to agree on a particular data value (such as the ordering and
makeup of blocks on a blockchain). There are a variety of algorithms used for determining consensus.
The consensus algorithm used by {{ polkadot: Polkadot :polkadot }}{{ kusama: Kusama :kusama }} is
[GRANDPA](#grandpa-finality-gadget).

## Crowdloan

A mechanism for potential parachains to temporarily source tokens to win an auction for a parachain
slot. Tokens gathered in this way are programmatically returned to the lender after the lease period
is over or the crowdloan period ends.

## Curator

A person, group, or other entity charged with judging and verifying the successful completion of a
Bounty.

## Dapps

A generic term for a decentralized application, that is, one that runs as part of a distributed
network as opposed to being run on a specific system or set of systems.

## DOT

The native token for Polkadot. DOT serves three purposes: network governance (allowing them to vote
on-chain upgrades and other exceptional events), general operation (rewarding good actors and
punishing bad actors), and bonding (adding new parachains by "freezing" DOT while they are connected
the Relay Chain).

## Duty Roster

A lookup table that specifies the job that a particular validator is required to do (i.e. attest to
the validity of a specific parachain). The duty roster routinely shuffles the validator set into
different subsets per parachain.

## Epoch

An epoch is a time duration in the BABE protocol that is broken into smaller time slots. Each slot
has at least one slot leader who has the right to propose a block. In Kusama, it is the same
duration as a [session](#session).

## Era

A (whole) number of sessions, which is the period that the validator set (and each validator's
active nominator set) is recalculated and where rewards are paid out.

## Equivocation

Providing conflicting information to the network. BABE equivocation entails creating multiple blocks
in the same slot. [GRANDPA](#grandpa-finality-gadget) equivocation would consist of signing multiple
conflicting chains.

## External Queue

The queue for proposals originating with the
{{ polkadot: Polkadot :polkadot }}{{ kusama: Kusama :kusama }} Council which are waiting to become
referenda. Compare the Community queue.

## Extrinsic

A [SCALE encoded](https://docs.substrate.io/reference/scale-codec/) array consisting of a version
number, signature, and varying data types indicating the resulting runtime function to be called,
including the parameters required for that function to be executed. These state changes are invoked
from the outside world, i.e. they are not part of the system itself. Extrinsics can take two forms,
"[inherents](#inherent)" and "[transactions](#transaction)". For more technical details see the
[polkadot spec](https://spec.polkadot.network/#id-extrinsics)

## Fellowship

A mostly self-governing expert body with a primary goal of representing humans who embody and
contain the technical knowledge base of the Kusama and/or Polkadot networks and protocols.

## Finality

The property of a block that cannot be reverted. Generally, created blocks are not final until some
point in the future - perhaps never, in the case of "probabilistic finality". The
{{ polkadot: Polkadot :polkadot }}{{ kusama: Kusama :kusama }} Relay Chain uses a deterministic
finality gadget known as [GRANDPA](#grandpa-finality-gadget).

## Finality Gadget

A mechanism that determines finality.

## Frame

The collection of Substrate-provided pallets (Substrate Runtime Modules).

## Genesis

The origin of a blockchain, also known as block 0. It can also be used to reference the initial
state of the blockchain at origination.

:::note Example

In the _genesis_ state Alice, Bob, and Charlie had 30 tokens each.

:::

## Governance

The process of determining what changes to the network are permissible, such as modifications to
code or movement of funds. The governance system in
{{ polkadot: Polkadot :polkadot }}{{ kusama: Kusama :kusama }} is on-chain and revolves around
stakeholder voting.

## Governance Council

An on-chain entity that consists of several on-chain accounts (starting at 6, eventually moving to
the final value of 24). The Council can act as a representative for "passive" (non-voting)
stakeholders. Council members have two main tasks: proposing referenda for the overall stakeholder
group to vote on and cancelling malicious referenda.

## GRANDPA Finality Gadget

GHOST-based Recursive ANcestor Deriving Prefix Agreement. It is the finality gadget for
{{ polkadot: Polkadot, :polkadot }}{{ kusama: Kusama, :kusama }} which allows asynchronous,
accountable, and safe finality to the blockchain. For an overview of GRANDPA, see
[this Medium post](https://medium.com/polkadot-network/polkadot-proof-of-concept-3-a-better-consensus-algorithm-e81c380a2372)

## Hard Fork

A permanent diversion of a blockchain occurs quickly due to a high priority change in a consensus
rule. Clients who follow a hard fork always need to upgrade their clients to continue following the
upgraded chain. Hard forks are considered permanent divergences of a chain for which non-upgraded
clients are following consensus rules incompatible to the ones followed by upgraded clients.

## Hard Spoon

Defined by Jae Kwon of Cosmos as "a new chain that takes into account state from an existing chain;
not to compete, but to provide broad access." A non-contentious blockchain that inherits the state
of the underlying blockchain and creates a new branch of _the same blockchain_.

## Horizontal Relay-routed Message Passing

Horizontal Relay-routed Message Passing, also known as HRMP, is a precursor to the complete XCMP
implementation, that mimics the same interface and semantics of XCMP. It is similar to XCMP except
for how it stores all messages in the Relay Chain storage, therefore making it more expensive and
demanding more resources than XCMP. The plan is to retire HRMP once the implementation of XCMP is
complete.

## Inactive Nomination

A validator (or validators) that a nominator has selected to nominate, but is not actively
validating this era. This type of nomination may become active in a future era.

## Inherent

Extrinsics that are "inherently true." Inherents are not gossiped on the network and are put into
blocks by the block author. They are not provably true the way that the desire to send funds is,
therefore they do not carry a signature. A blockchain's [runtime](#runtime) must have rules for
validating inherents. For example, timestamps are inherents. They are validated by being within some
margin that each validator deems reasonable.

## Injected Account

An account that is not directly managed by the Polkadot UI but can be accessed through it, such as
accounts controlled by the Polkadot{.js} extension.

## Interoperability

The ability for some sort of system to exchange and make use of information often compared to
"cross-chain" technologies.

## Keep-Alive Check

The keep-alive check is used to indicate whether or not a transfer can allow the sending account to
be reduced to less than the existential deposit, causing it to be reaped.

## KSM

The abbreviation for Kusama network tokens.

## Kusama

The "canary network" for Polkadot. It consists of an early-release, unaudited version of the
Polkadot software. It is **not** a [testnet](#testnet) - after the transition to NPoS, the network
is entirely in the hands of the community (i.e., Kusama token holders).

## Lease Period

A particular amount of time that a parachain for which the parachain can connect to the Relay Chain.

## LIBP2P

An open-source library for encrypted peer-to-peer communications and other networking functions.
More information at: [https://libp2p.io/](https://libp2p.io/)

## Liveness

The property of a distributed system is that it will eventually come to some sort of consensus. A
system stuck in an infinite loop would not be considered live, even if computations are taking
place; a system that eventually provides a result, even if incorrect or it takes a long time, is
considered to have liveness.

## Mainnet

Short for "main network": the fully functional and acting chain that runs its own network.

## Message

In {{ polkadot: Polkadot :polkadot }}{{ kusama: Kusama :kusama }}'s XCMP protocol, a _message_ is
arbitrary data that is sent from one parachain (the egress chain) to another (the ingress chain)
through a channel and ensured delivery by the validator set.

## Message Queue

In {{ polkadot: Polkadot :polkadot }}{{ kusama: Kusama :kusama }}'s XCMP protocol, a _message queue_
is the list of messages waiting to be processed by a particular receiving parachain over a channel.

## Metadata

Data that includes information about other data, such as information about a specific transaction.

## Motion

A motion is essentially a "referendum" or "decision" being considered by the Council. The Council
can vote on motions like approving Treasury Proposals or making proposals for the community to vote
on.

## Next Session

This indicates that the validator will be a member of the active set in the next session.

## Node Explorer

A tool that gives you information about a node, such as the latest blocks sealed, finalized, and the
current chain state as known by that node.

## Nominated Proof of Stake (NPoS)

A Proof-of-Stake system where nominators back validators with their own stake as a show of faith in
the good behavior of the validator. Nominated Proof-of-Stake differs from the more generic concept
Delegated Proof-of-Stake in that nominators are subject to loss of stake if they nominate a bad
validator; delegators are not subject to loss of stake based on the behavior of the validator. Note
that some other blockchain technologies may use the term Delegated Proof-of-Stake, even if
delegators can be slashed. {{ polkadot: Polkadot :polkadot }}{{ kusama: Kusama :kusama }} uses the
Phragmén method to allocate stake to nominees.

## Nominator

Accounts that select a set of validators to nominate by bonding their tokens. Nominators receive
some of the validators' rewards, but are also liable for slashing if their nominated validators
misbehave.

## Non-fungible Token (NFT)

A non-fungible token is a token that does not hold the property of fungibility, which, in turn,
means that it cannot be interchangeable and indistinguishable from other tokens. NFTs allow the
tokenization of unique items and provide exclusive ownership for those tokens.

## On-chain Governance

A governance system of a blockchain that is controlled by mechanisms on the blockchain. On-chain
governance allows decisions to be made transparently. Note that there are a variety of different
algorithms for making these decisions, such as simple majority voting, adaptive quorum biasing, or
identity-based quadratic voting.

## Online Message

This is a message that is broadcast by a validator to verify to the network that the validator is
online, even if they haven't published a block this epoch. This is sometimes referred to as
"ImOnline".

## Polkadot OpenGov

Previously known as Governance v2 (Gov2) during early development,
[Polkadot OpenGov](../learn/learn-polkadot-opengov) serves as the current governance protocol for
both Kusama and Polkadot.

## Origin

The initiator of an extrinsic. A simple origin would be the account that is sending a token to
another account. {{ polkadot: Polkadot :polkadot }}{{ kusama: Kusama :kusama }} also supports more
complex origin types, such as the [root origin](#root-origin), from which privileged functions can
be called.

## Oversubscribed

If more than the maximum number of nominators nominate the same validator, it is "oversubscribed",
and only the top staked nominators (ranked by the amount of stake, up to the maximum number of
nominators) are paid rewards. Other nominators will receive no rewards for that era. The current
maximum number of nominators is
{{ polkadot: <RPC network="polkadot" path="consts.staking.maxNominatorRewardedPerValidator" defaultValue={512}/> on Polkadot, :polkadot }}
{{ kusama: <RPC network="kusama" path="consts.staking.maxNominatorRewardedPerValidator" defaultValue={516}/> on Kusama, :kusama }}
but it can be modified via governance.

## Pallet

A [Substrate](#substrate) runtime module.

## Parachain

A blockchain that meets several characteristics that allow it to work within the confines of the
{{ polkadot: Polkadot :polkadot }}{{ kusama: Kusama :kusama }} Host. Also known as "parallelized
chain."

## Parachain Development Kit (PDK)

Similar to an [SDK](#sdk), parachain development kits (PDK) is a set of tools that make it easy for
developers to create {{ polkadot: Polkadot :polkadot }}{{ kusama: Kusama :kusama }} compatible
[parachains](#parachain).

## ParaID

A unique numeric (non-negative integer) identifier for a parathread.

## Parathread

A blockchain that works within the confines of the
{{ polkadot: Polkadot :polkadot }}{{ kusama: Kusama :kusama }} Host, thus allowing it to connect to
the Polkadot Relay Chain. This can be done either by becoming a parachain or connecting on a "pay as
you go" basis. All parachains start their life-cycle as a parathread.

## Parachain Registry

A relatively simple database-like construct that holds both static and dynamic information on each
chain.

## Parity Technologies

A company, founded by Dr. Gavin Wood and Dr. Jutta Steiner, that is developing Substrate, Kusama and
Polkadot. It has also released several other projects including Parity Ethereum and Parity Secret
Store.

## Polkadot

A heterogeneous, multi-chain network allowing various blockchains of different characteristics to
perform arbitrary, cross-chain communication under shared security.

## Polkadot Alliance

The Polkadot Alliance is an [on-chain collective](#collectives) founded by Acala, Astar, Interlay,
Kilt, Moonbeam, Phala, and Subscan, to establish standards and ethics for open-source development in
[referendum #94](https://polkadot.polkassembly.io/referendum/94). It aims to support development
standards and expose bad actors within the ecosystems of Polkadot.

## Host

The environment in which a runtime module can be executed. Parachains must support the
{{ polkadot: Polkadot :polkadot }}{{ kusama: Kusama :kusama }} Host - external chains that do not
will have to use a bridge. Previously known as the
{{ polkadot: Polkadot :polkadot }}{{ kusama: Kusama :kusama }} Runtime Environment.

## Runtime Environment

The previous name for the {{ polkadot: Polkadot :polkadot }}{{ kusama: Kusama :kusama }}
[Host](#polkadot-host).

## Preimage

The on-chain proposals do not require the entire image of extrinsics and data (for instance the WASM
code, in case of upgrades) to be submitted, but would rather just need that image's hash. That
**preimage** can be submitted and stored on-chain against the hash later, upon the proposal's
dispatch.

## Proof of Stake (PoS)

A method of selecting participation in a consensus system, in which participants are chosen based on
how many tokens they have at stake (at risk of loss due to misbehavior). Normally, Proof-of-Stake
systems limit the number of participants.

## Proof of Validity

A proof produced by parachain collators. Based on this proof and the parachain registry, a validator
can verify that a parachain has properly executed its state transition function. Proofs of Validity
go into the Relay Chain blocks.

## Proof of Work (PoW)

A method of selecting participants in a consensus system, typically the longest chain rule, in which
participants try to solve a puzzle like finding a partial pre-image of a hash. Normally, a
Proof-of-Work system can have any number of participants.

## Proposal

A potential function call to be voted on in a referendum. Proposals modify the behavior of the
{{ polkadot: Polkadot :polkadot }}{{ kusama: Kusama :kusama }} network, from minor parameter tuning
up to replacing the runtime code.

## Protocol

A system of rules that allows two or more entities of a communications system to transmit
information. The protocol defines the rules, syntax, semantics, and synchronization of communication
and possible recovery methods.

## Random Seed

A random seed is a pseudo-random number available on-chain. It is used in various places of the
{{ polkadot: Polkadot :polkadot }}{{ kusama: Kusama :kusama }} protocol, most prominently in
[BABE](#babe) the block production mechanism.

## Referendum

A vote on whether or not a proposal should be accepted by the network. Referenda may be initiated by
the Governance Council, by a member of the public, or as the result of a previous proposal.
Stakeholders vote on referenda, weighted by both the size of their stake (i.e. number of DOT held)
and the amount of time they are willing to lock their tokens.

## Re-Genesis

Re-Genesis is the process of exporting the current chain state, and creating a new chain that builds
on it. Re-Genesis will involve stop-the-world migration, which results in a period of time when no
actual blocks are added to the blockchain. In a way, re-genesis can be viewed as a hard fork
process. A formal design of Re-Genesis on Substrate is still under development -
[Re-Genesis Rationale and Design](https://github.com/paritytech/substrate/issues/7458).

## Relay Chain

The chain that coordinates consensus and communication between parachains (and external chains, via
bridges).

## Remarks

Remarks are extrinsics with no effect. They provide additional information to external inputs,
acting as _notes_. Remarks are stored alongside block records and do not change the chain's storage;
the information is not stored in the chain's trie, but along blocks.

## Rococo

The [testnet](#testnet) set aside for testing parachains, cumulus, and related technology.

## Root Origin

A system-level origin in [Substrate](#Substrate). This is the highest privilege level and can be
thought of as the superuser of the runtime origin. To learn about more raw origins in Substrate,
visit [Substrate Docs](https://docs.substrate.io/main-docs/build/origins/)

## Runtime

The state transition function of a blockchain. It defines a valid algorithm for determining the
state of the next block given the previous state.

## Runtime Module

A module that implements specific transition functions and features one might want to have in their
runtime. Each module should have domain-specific logic. For example, a Balances module has logic to
deal with accounts and balances. In Substrate, modules are called "pallets".

## Safety

The property of a distributed system indicating that a particular state transition will not be
reverted. [GRANDPA](#grandpa-finality-gadget) provides _deterministic_ safety. That is, for a state
changed marked as "safe" or "final", one would require a hard fork to revert that change.

## Scalability

While an ambiguous concept, [blockchain] scalability can be understood as the ability for the
network to scale in capabilities (e.g. processing more transactions) when needed.

## Sealing

The process of adding a block to the Relay Chain. Note that finalization is a separate process -
blocks are finalized sometime after they are sealed.

## Session

A session is a Substrate implementation term for a period that has a constant set of validators.
Validators can only join or exit the validator set at a session change.

## Session Certificate

A message containing a signature on the concatenation of all the Session keys.

## Session Key

Hot keys that are used for performing network operations by validators, for example, signing
[GRANDPA](#grandpa-finality-gadget) commit messages.

## Shared Security

The security model that {{ polkadot: Polkadot :polkadot }}{{ kusama: Kusama :kusama }} uses whereby
all chains are equally secured. This is achieved by placing proofs of the validity of parachain
blocks into the Relay Chain such that, in order to revert finality of a single parachain, an
attacker would need to attack the entire
{{ polkadot: Polkadot :polkadot }}{{ kusama: Kusama :kusama }} system.

## Slashing

The removal of a percentage of an account's DOT as a punishment for a validator acting maliciously
or incompetently (e.g., equivocating or remaining offline for an extended period).

## Soft Fork

A backward compatible change to client code causes upgraded clients to start mining a new chain.
Requires a "vote-by-hashrate" of a majority of miners to enact successfully. Soft forks are
considered temporary divergences in a chain since non-upgraded clients do not follow the new
consensus rules but upgraded clients are still compatible with old consensus rules.

## Software Development Kit (SDK)

A collection of software tools (and programs) packaged together that can be used to develop
software.

## Spend Period

Successfully enacted Treasury track referenda will get funded at the end of the spending period that
resets every
{{ polkadot: <RPC network="polkadot" path="consts.treasury.spendPeriod" defaultValue={345600} filter="blocksToDays"/> :polkadot }}
{{ kusama: <RPC network="kusama" path="consts.treasury.spendPeriod" defaultValue={86400} filter="blocksToDays"/> :kusama }}
days. Treasury funds are directly sent to the beneficiary account at the end of the spend period.

## Staking

The act of bonding tokens for {{ polkadot: Polkadot (DOT) :polkadot }}
{{ kusama: Kusama (KSM) :kusama }} by putting them up as "collateral" for a chance to produce a
valid block (and thus obtain a block reward). Validators and nominators stake their
{{ polkadot: DOT :polkadot }} {{ kusama: KSM :kusama }} in order to secure the network.

## State transition function

A function that describes how the state of a blockchain can be transformed. For example, it may
describe how tokens can be transferred from one account to another.

## Substrate

A modular framework for building blockchains.
{{ polkadot: Polkadot :polkadot }}{{ kusama: Kusama :kusama }} is built using
[Substrate](https://substrate.io/). Chains built with Substrate will be easy to connect as
parachains. For developers, see the
[Substrate GitHub repository](https://github.com/paritytech/substrate).

## System Parachains

Parachains that are part of the Polkadot core protocol. These are allocated a parachain execution
core by governance rather than auction.

## Tabling

In {{ polkadot: Polkadot :polkadot }}{{ kusama: Kusama :kusama }} governance, bringing a proposal to
a vote via referendum. Note that this is the British meaning of "tabling", which is different from
the US version, which means "to postpone" a measure.

## Teleport

Send an asset from an account on one chain to an account on a different chain. This occurs by
burning an amount on the sending chain and minting an equivalent amount on the destination chain.

## Testnet

Short for "test network": an experimental network where testing and development takes place.
Networks are often executed on a testnet before they are deployed to a [mainnet](#mainnet).

## Tokenization

The process of replacing sensitive data with non-sensitive data.

## Tracks

Each [Origin](#origin) is associated with a single referendum class and each class is associated
with a [Track](../maintain/maintain-guides-polkadot-opengov#origins-and-tracks). The Track outlines
the lifecycle for the proposal and is independent from other class's tracks. Having independent
tracks allows the network to tailor the dynamics of referenda based upon their implied privilege
level.

## Tranche

Validators use a subjective, tick-based system to determine when the approval process should start.
A validator starts the tick-based system when a new availability core candidates have been proposed,
which can be retrieved via the
[Runtime API](https://spec.polkadot.network/#sect-rt-api-availability-cores), and increments the
tick every 500 milliseconds. Each tick/increment is referred to as a “tranche”, represented as an
integer, starting at 0.

## Transfer

Send an asset from one account to another. This generally refers to transfers that occur only on the
same chain.

## Transaction

An extrinsic that is signed. Transactions are gossiped on the network and incur a transaction fee.
Transactions are "provably true", unlike inherents. For example, one can prove that Alice wants to
send funds to Bob by the fact that she signed a transfer-funds message with her private key.

## Validator

A node that secures the Relay Chain by staking DOT, validating proofs from collators on parachains
and voting on consensus along with other validators.

## Vertical Message Passing

Vertical message passing consists of two separate types of message passing, Downward Message Passing
(DMP) and Upward Message Passing (UMP). Downward messages pass from the Relay Chain to a parachain,
although they may also originate from another parachain via
[HRMP](#Horizontal-Relay-routed-Message-Passing). Upward messages originate from parachains and go
up to the Relay Chain via runtime entry points.

## Voting

The process of stakeholders determining whether or not a referendum should pass. Votes are weighted
both by the number of DOT that the stakeholder account controls and the amount of time they are
willing to lock their DOT.

## Waiting Nomination

The nominator has nominated this validator, but the validator was not elected into the active
validator set this era and thus cannot produce blocks for the canonical chain. If the validator does
get into the active set in a future era, this may turn into an active or inactive nomination.

## Wallet

A program that allows one to store private keys and sign transactions for
{{ polkadot: Polkadot :polkadot }}{{ kusama: Kusama :kusama }} or other blockchain networks.

## Wasm

The abbreviation for [WebAssembly](#webassembly).

## Watermark

In Polkadot's parachain messaging scheme, the _watermark_ is the minimum processed send-height of
the receiving parachain. All messages on all channels that are sending to this parachain at or
before the watermark are guaranteed to be processed.

## Web3 Foundation

A Switzerland-based foundation that nurtures and stewards technologies and applications in the
fields of decentralized web software protocols, particularly those that utilize modern cryptographic
methods to safeguard decentralization, to the benefit and for the stability of the
[Web3 ecosystem](./web3-and-polkadot.md).

## WebAssembly

An instruction format for a virtual, stack-based machine.
{{ polkadot: Polkadot :polkadot }}{{ kusama: Kusama :kusama }} Runtime Modules are compiled to
WebAssembly. Also known as Wasm.

## Weights

A permission-less system needs to implement a mechanism to measure and limit usage in order to
establish an economic incentive structure, to prevent the network overload, and to mitigate DoS
vulnerabilities. This mechanism must enforce a limited time-window for block producers to create a
block and include limitations on block size, to prevent execution of certain extrinsics which are
deemed too expensive and could decelerate the network. This is handled by the weight system, where
the cost of the transactions (referred to as [extrinsics](#extrinsic)) are determined before
execution. Checkout this section of the Substrate docs covering
[transaction weights and fees](https://docs.substrate.io/build/tx-weights-fees/).

## Witness

Cryptographic proof statements of data validity.

## Whitelist Pallet

Allows one [Origin ](#origin) to escalate the privilege level of another Origin for a certain
operation. In terms of OpenGov, it allows the [Fellowship](#fellowship) to authorise a new origin
(which we will call Whitelisted-Root) to be executed with Root-level privileges.

Many projects are being built, or intend to build, on both Polkadot and Kusama. However, many claim
to do so but have either no such intention, they do not have the resources to pull it through, or
they are outright trying to scam people by misusing the Polkadot and Kusama brands.

Distinguishing legitimate projects from the dishonest ones is not always an easy task. This guide is
meant to help you find out how to do your research better when you come across a project that seems
interesting. What it's **not** meant to do, is label any single project as legitimate or not, or
make that decision for you.

Furthermore, a legitimate project does not necessarily mean it will also be successful, and **this
guide is not meant to be viewed as financial or investment advice.**

### "Powered by Polkadot" or "Polka" prefix clarification

The statement "Powered by Polkadot" on many projects' sites is often a cause of confusion. This
usually means that the project is building, or intends to build, on the Polkadot ecosystem, using
[Substrate](https://substrate.io). But any project can claim that, so the existence of this
statement on a project's site infers no information about the project's legitimacy, and it's
certainly not a "seal of approval" by Web3 Foundation.

This also applies for projects with a "Polka" prefix in their name. Many projects use that to
associate themselves with the ecosystem, some legitimately and others only to piggyback on
Polkadot's reputation.

## "Hard" metrics to look for when you DYOR

#### 1. Association with entities you trust

New projects usually try to increase their credibility by associating themselves with well-known
entities. The thinking is simple: "These entities that have a good reputation trust us, so if you
trust them, by association, you should trust us too". Indeed, association with a trusted entity can
be a strong indicator of the legitimacy of a project.

For example, if a project had received a
[Web3 Foundation Grant](https://github.com/w3f/Open-Grants-Program), this is an indication that the
project is indeed building on the Polkadot ecosystem, and if they have delivered all of their
milestones, then their code is most likely of reasonable quality.

Furthermore, Web3 Foundation is not the only entity in the ecosystem that provides grants. Other
reputable teams in the ecosystem that have developed platforms or prospective parachains provide
grants for projects to build on or expand their project. These are also indicators that a project is
committed to building on the broader {{ polkadot: Polkadot :Polkadot }}{{ kusama: Kusama :kusama }}
ecosystem.

Receiving funding from reputable VCs and are known to be involved with other reputable
{{ polkadot: Polkadot :Polkadot }}{{ kusama: Kusama :kusama }} projects can also be a good
indicator. Or participating in the
[Substrate Builders Program](https://www.substrate.io/builders-program/).

**However**, claiming such associations and having them is not always the same thing. **You always
need to verify any claims a project makes**, and that is probably the most critical takeaway from
this guide.

For example, if a project has the
[Web3 Foundation Grant badge](https://github.com/w3f/General-Grants-Program/blob/master/grants/grant-badge-guidelines.md)
on their site or claims to have received a grant, check to see if they have received one and that it
has not been terminated. The complete list of projects that have successfully applied for a grant
can be found
[here](https://github.com/w3f/General-Grants-Program/blob/master/grants/accepted_grant_applications.md),
where you can see what each project has delivered and if, perhaps, their grant has been terminated.

The same thing goes for VC funding or another grant, or any advertised association for that matter.
Check on the corresponding sites to make sure such claims are valid.

Also, make sure you understand the _scope_ of the association. Going back to the Web3 grants
example, they have a precise scope. They are granted for specific deliverables, and the review team
only checks the code and evaluates these deliverables _of the particular project_. So, having
received a Web3 grant provides no information about the general practices of a team, the longevity
of the project besides the scope of the grant, or other projects the team might be building, which
is why the badge rules clearly state that it should not be displayed on the team's landing page.

Similarly, if a project claims to have partnered with a reputable entity, verify its scope and if it
is indeed a partnership by searching their site for projects they have partnered with, their press
releases, or by contacting them directly. And if you see such claims about Web3 Foundation, you can
be sure they're false because Web3 Foundation **does not** partner with, or endorse, ecosystem
projects.

#### 2. Open source

An open-source project promotes transparency, builds trust, and potentially ensures project team
honesty. Additionally, it makes it very easy to track the project's progress and see how active the
team is in developing it.

However, that does not mean that any closed source project is not legitimate or the team behind it
has something to hide. Many teams choose to keep their code private to protect their intellectual
property. And several teams that do so have gotten a
[General Grant](https://github.com/w3f/General-Grants-Program), under which members of the grants
review team review their private code.

Another thing that an open-source project allows you to see is if they have copied any code from
other open sources. This isn't necessarily bad, since no one wants to re-invents the wheel, but
copied code should attribute to the source. If it doesn't, this should raise some red flags because
the project team tries to feign expertise by passing someone else's code as their own.

A forked repo is easy to spot since it points to the original repo, but partially copied code might
not be as easy to find. A quick
[search](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=search+for+copied+source+code+plagiarism&t=ffab&ia=web) can
provide you with some ways and tools to look for plagiarism.

So, a project being closed source is not necessarily a red flag. It just limits the ability to
verify the project in that regard, but there are indirect ways as described below. However, a
project being open source is undoubtedly a potentially strong indicator of its legitimacy because
shady or poor practices seldom stay hidden for long in open source code.

#### 3. Active development

If a project team constantly updates their product, it is always a good indication that they are
serious and passionate about building. Regularly releasing new features and upgrades, fixing bugs,
updating their site and notifying the community of these changes are good earmarks of a legitimate
project.

Additionally, active development _usually_ also means good development to be used as an _indirect_
indicator for a closed source project.

An open-source project allows anyone to monitor the development activity through its code repository
directly, such as through GitHub.

#### 4. Comprehensive documentation

The existence of comprehensive documentation should be considered mandatory for any serious project.
A couple of years ago, this meant a whitepaper, but lately, we have seen a shift to other forms of
documentation, like wiki pages describing the various aspects.

No matter the form of the documentation, its existence and completion is necessary, and the more
detailed it is, the better. This is where the details of the project or parts of the project are
explained in full for prospective investors or users.

The documentation will also give you an idea of the technical expertise of the team. If the team
analyses their technology and technical aspects, this is a potential indication of technical
prowess. On the other hand, if the team focuses only on tokenomics or analyses their project only in
broad, vague terms, this is potentially an indication that there is not a clear path to their goals.

If you are looking for an example of good documentation, look no further than our own
[wiki](https://wiki.polkadot.network). Of course, you should not expect to find such extensive
documentation on newly launched projects. Our wiki, after all, covers a whole ecosystem and was
populated over the course of multiple years. Updates are also constantly being pushed out and edits
are consistently being made. Nevertheless, this wiki provides a good example of the documentation a
legitimate project should provide.

#### 5. Reputable team

Some teams display their team members prominently on their site, along with their social media
profiles (usually LinkedIn) and GitHub accounts. This gives prospective users and investors the
ability to verify the team's credentials, track records, and expertise.

But the keyword here is **verify**! Do not take what you see on the project's team at face value.
Look them up and verify their track record. Do a Google search for the team members mentioned. If it
comes up empty, or the only results are regarding the project you are researching, it is an
indication that their team members are potentially fake. Their photos on their site, if there are
any, may also be stock photos, or in other words, also fake. These are usually easily recognisable,
but here is a [guide](https://helpdeskgeek.com/how-to/free-reverse-image-search-tools/) on how to do
a reverse image search, if you want to be thorough.

In some other cases, some developers prefer to maintain their anonymity, using pseudonyms, or the
team members are not mentioned at all. This is not necessarily a bad thing. Perhaps the team is a
strong proponent of privacy, or they want their work to speak for itself. Still, you should try and
find out who is behind the project and what they are doing. For developers, their GitHub activity
may be a stronger indicator of honesty. Other team members might be heavily engaged in their
community, providing guidance and answers, which is always a good sign.

But if the team are ghosts that do not show up anywhere and only engage with the community through
proxies, this can be considered a red flag and extra precaution should be taken.

Besides their community, projects that are serious about building on
{{ polkadot: Polkadot :Polkadot }}{{ kusama: Kusama :kusama }} usually engage with the broader
{{ polkadot: Polkadot :Polkadot }}{{ kusama: Kusama :kusama }} community. They are active in the
various [Polkadot and Kusama channels](https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/community/), and some of
them are [Polkadot Ambassadors](https://polkadot.network/polkadot-ambassador-program/), or generally
prominent members of the ecosystem.

#### 6. Clear integration

There are many ways for a project to build on
{{ polkadot: Polkadot :Polkadot }}{{ kusama: Kusama :kusama }}. Perhaps the most direct one is to
aim to become a parachain. Some of the most notable
{{ polkadot: Polkadot :Polkadot }}{{ kusama: Kusama :kusama }} projects are already parachains on
Kusama or gearing up to become one, and most of them may also bid for Polkadot parachain slots when
live.

Of course, getting a parachain slot on either of the two main networks is not guaranteed, and all
projects will need to win an [auction](https://kusama.network/auctions/) for a parachain slot.

Verifying which projects are currently parachains on Kusama can be quickly done by visiting the
[parachains](https://polkadot.js.org/apps/#/parachains) page on
[polkadot.js.org/apps](https://polkadot.js.org/apps). In the
[parathreads](https://polkadot.js.org/apps/#/parachains/parathreads) page you can see which projects
are preparing to claim a parachain slot, the
[auctions](https://polkadot.js.org/apps/#/parachains/auctions) page shows which projects are bidding
for the next slot, and the [crowdloan](https://polkadot.js.org/apps/#/parachains/crowdloan) page
shows which projects are gathering funds from their community to participate in auctions.

But not all projects that build a chain using [Substrate](https://substrate.io) aim to become a
parachain. Some use it simply because of its infrastructure to build their customised chain, without
any plans to connect to the Relay Chain. And other projects may aim to become a parachain only on
Kusama or directly on Polkadot.

However, building a potential parachain is not the only way to build on
{{ polkadot: Polkadot :Polkadot }}{{ kusama: Kusama :kusama }} and expand its ecosystem. A project
might aim to build a DeFi platform on a parachain, launch a stablecoin or other token on the Asset
Hub, build a decentralized exchange, or any other dApp that one might think of, without ever
touching the Relay Chain. And that's the beauty of
{{ polkadot: Polkadot! :Polkadot }}{{ kusama: Kusama! :kusama }}

But in all of those cases, their plans to build on
{{ polkadot: Polkadot, :Polkadot }}{{ kusama: Kusama, :kusama }} whatever they may be, should be
clearly stated on their site and in their documentation. Most importantly, you should look for an
explanation of _how_ they plan to achieve that integration. A roadmap that places the integration at
some point in the future means close to nothing without clearly stating the steps to get there.
These plans should be evaluated in tandem with your research on the technical expertise of the team.

This is especially true for projects that are already running on another network, like on Ethereum
or Binance Smart Chain, and have issued tokens there. Many projects do that either to raise funds
and test their infrastructure or because they aim to build a "multi-chain" solution or both. But
because those projects are not currently built on Substrate, the existence of a clear and robust
integration plan with {{ polkadot: Polkadot :Polkadot }}{{ kusama: Kusama :kusama }} should be
essential in your research to ensure that they will indeed build on
{{ polkadot: Polkadot :Polkadot }}{{ kusama: Kusama :kusama }} one day.

## "Soft" metrics

The items above are what you should look at first when evaluating a project and should carry most of
the weight in your decision. The reason is that they are hard to fake or manipulate, assuming that
you are able to verify the information found. Hence we called them "hard" metrics.

But there are other things to look for that might point to a project's legitimacy but can be more
easily manipulated, so they should not affect your decision heavily. These are called "soft"
metrics.

#### 1. Site quality

The quality of a project's site could sometimes provide insights into the legitimacy of a project. A
poorly constructed site, may:

- have typos, grammatical errors, or poor styling
- be a template without any serious effort to improve or change it
- hold little information about the project, without links to their GitHub or other resources
- not "feel" professional

These are all potential indications that the team is not serious about this project.

But that does not mean that all well-designed sites are also solid projects. This is a soft metric,
after all. Many projects that do not have any plans to build anything substantial still have
excellent, or even beautiful-looking, sites. They put many resources into how they present
themselves visually to mislead. So, an excellent site does not necessarily indicate a legitimate
project, a poor site might indicate an illegitimate one, but the site quality alone usually is not
enough to reach a conclusion. None of these metrics are sufficient alone; you need to look into all
of them to make an educated decision.

#### 2. Social media presence

Having a vibrant community is a good indication of a legitimate project. A team that engages with
their community, gives updates, answers questions, holds AMAs, and posts articles, is a team that is
interested in keeping their community members updated and informed.

Though at the same time, social media presence and engagement can be easily faked and manipulated.
Creating a Telegram group or a Discord server and filling it with thousands of bots is very easy.
Although bot users need to be identified on Discord according to its terms, scammers have little
regard for terms and conditions.

A team that tweets five times a day or posts a Medium article every other day may not necessarily be
the building something substantial.

So, make sure that you verify that their social media presence and engagement is genuine. Join their
channels, ask questions and see first-hand what the community and the admins look like. If you are
seeing a lot of users posting very brief comments, like "Good project", "To the moon", "Thank you"
etc, without really engaging, remain skeptical and maintain a critical eye, as these are probably
bots. Additionally, verify any information shared by the team on social media and also verify the
comments of users.

#### 3. Media presence

Related to social media presence is media presence: third-party articles, mentions in YouTube
videos, and general promotions of the project.

When it comes to articles, the first thing to check is if the article is genuine coverage or a paid
press release, especially when a project displays this coverage prominently on their page. Or if the
author has any vested interest in promoting the project. You can check their previous articles to
see if they systematically "shill" this project or other projects in general.

This especially applies for YouTubers and influencers in general, who may be dishonest. Many of them
do this for a living or as a way to "pump" projects they have invested in. Finding good influencers
that provide as objective info as possible usually involves its own separate research.

That is not to say that media exposure is terrible. It is probably the most abundant source of
information outside the project itself, but at the same time, it requires extensive cross-checking
and verification of information.

#### 4. Email communication

Nowadays, many projects use Telegram, Discord, or similar apps for community engagement, as well as
the sole channel for communication, updates, and support. But having an email registered with their
domain, besides providing another channel of communication, can be considered an additional
credibility criterion.

Furthermore, receiving emails from the project's domain makes it easy to verify that the
communication is authentic (but look out for spoofed emails!). On the other hand, communicating
through personal emails or using a public email provider, like Google or Yahoo, might indicate a
less serious team or one that is spread too thin.

## Crowdloans

With the recent launch of [parachains](../learn/learn-parachains.md) on Kusama, many projects that
aim to become a parachain launched a [crowdloan](../learn/learn-crowdloans.md) to gather the
necessary funds to participate in the [parachain auctions](../learn/learn-auction.md). But with all
the buzz around the Kusama parachain launch and the imminent Polkadot launch, many scams will very
likely also surface. So, crowdloans require their own section to ensure participant safety.

First of all, only projects that aim to become a parachain should have a crowdloan. If a project is
not a parachain candidate, there should not be a crowdloan associated with it.

The optimal way to participate in a parachain crowdloan is through on-chain, via one of the
available [wallets or extensions](./wallets-and-extensions.md). Many parachain candidates offer a
way to participate through their site as well. However, you should ensure that they are using the
crowdloan pallet in the background and that they are simply wrapping that in a nicer, more
user-friendly interface. If their crowdloan interface _transfers_ funds to an account instead, these
funds will be totally under their control, and this means you need to fully trust that the team will
use the funds for the crowdloan, will return your share to you when the lease period ends or if they
do not win a slot, and will secure the funds properly. If their crowdloan involves this kind of
mechanism, it should be explicitly mentioned in their site and documentation.

That being said, some teams have been doing token sales or swaps in an attempt to get a head start
in raising funds for the auctions, but these are **not crowdloans** and still require full trust in
the team. So, if you plan to participate in these token swaps, make sure the project is reputable
and that you are getting the correct information through their official site and social media
channels.

Similarly, several centralized exchanges are creating ways to participate in crowdloans through
their platforms, while some wallets are integrating crowdloan functionality into their apps. And
more are sure to follow. Any legitimate effort should be using the native crowdloans module in the
background and offering a more streamlined user experience. Confirming this is necessary before
using these services, but in any case, it still involves trusting the exchange or the service
provider.

### Additional material

Fact-checking is a skill necessary not only for DYOR but also for filtering out the plethora of
information that we come across on the internet on a daily basis. If you are interested in learning
more about fact-checking and claim verification, have a look at the following material.

1. A very nice YouTube series on the art of fact-checking that covers a lot of ground can be found
   [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4aNmdL3Hr0&list=PL8dPuuaLjXtN07XYqqWSKpPrtNDiCHTzU).
2. Another great resource on fact-checking, for those who prefer to read, can be found
   [here](https://webliteracy.pressbooks.com).
3. Wikipedia article on [fact-checking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fact-checking)

Finally, you should also check our complementary guide on [how to identify scams](scams.md), which
explains how to identify outright scams and avoid them, as well as how to protect your sensitive
information.

### One last piece of advice

Once you have read through this material and have done your research and have identified a project
as legitimate, it is also imperative that you understand what the project does and what novelty it
aims to bring to the ecosystem.

This does not fall under fact-checking and verifying claims, but it is important to mention: fully
understanding what something does and its prospective impact is an integral part of making an
informed decision, so do not overlook it.

:::info Need support with your Ledger Wallet?

If you need help using Ledger you can contact the
[**Polkadot Support Team**](https://support.polkadot.network/support/home).

:::

:::warning Please Note

Because of required WebUSB support, Ledger wallets currently only work on Chromium-based browsers
like Google Chrome.

:::

The {{ polkadot: Polkadot :polkadot }}{{ kusama: Kusama :kusama }} [Ledger](https://www.ledger.com/)
application is compatible with the Ledger Nano S and the Ledger Nano X devices. Ledger devices are
hardware wallets that keep your secret key secured on a physical device that does not expose it to
your computer or the internet. The private keys will not be leaked even if you connect your nano via
USB to your computer. Ledger devices are also hierarchical deterministic wallets (HD wallets), that
is:

- _Deterministic_ means that only one seed phrase generates all the accounts for different
  blockchain networks.
- _Hierarchical_ means that the accounts are generated in a tree-like structure for different
  purposes.

Ledger devices can be equipped with applications that are blockchain-specific. Third parties usually
develop such applications, enabling the user to transact securely on the blockchain network. The
Polkadot Ledger application allows you to manage
{{ polkadot: Polkadot's :polkadot }}{{ kusama: Kusama's :kusama }} native token,
{{ polkadot: DOT :polkadot }}{{ kusama: KSM :kusama }}. It supports most of the transaction types of
the network, including batch transactions from the Utility pallet.

:::note Ledger apps may not support all the transactions

Check the
{{ polkadot: [Ledger Polkadot App](https://github.com/Zondax/ledger-polkadot) :polkadot }}{{ kusama: [Ledger Kusama App](https://github.com/Zondax/ledger-kusama) :kusama }}
specification for the list of transactions supported. Some transactions are supported only on a
specific app version, and others are not supported by any version. For instance, the staking `rebag`
extrinsic is supported on the **XL version** but not on the **lite version**. Also, joining a
[nomination pool](../learn/learn-nomination-pools.md) is only possible with the XL version.

:::

If you have trouble using Ledger or following the directions below, you can try searching for your
issue on the [Polkadot support pages](https://support.polkadot.network/).

## Requirements

:::info For Ledger Nano S users only

The lite version of the Polkadot Ledger App that you can install by default in the Ledger Nano S has
limited functionality. The Ledger Nano S is no longer produced and has limited memory that is just
right to accommodate the XL version of the Polkadot Ledger App, which gives the user more
functionalities.

If you do use a Nano S with the XL version you will not be able to:

- Install any other Ledger application on your device
- Add Polkadot accounts to the Ledger Live App.

But you will be able to add them to [**wallets and extensions**](./wallets-and-extensions.md) that
support Ledger devices.

:::

Here is a list of what you will need before using
{{ polkadot: Polkadot :polkadot }}{{ kusama: Kusama :kusama }} with Ledger:

- A Ledger Nano X or Nano S plus (recommended for
  {{ polkadot: Polkadot :polkadot }}{{ kusama: Kusama :kusama }} Ledger App space requirements and
  functionalities).
- The latest firmware of the {{ polkadot: Polkadot :polkadot }}{{ kusama: Kusama :kusama }} Ledger
  App installed (always check for updates in Ledger Live under the "Manager" tab, you will need to
  allow access with your nano).
- Ledger Live is installed and up-to-date.
- A Chromium-based web browser if you use a browser extension.

## Using Ledger Live

See
[this support article](https://support.polkadot.network/support/solutions/articles/65000175822-how-to-use-polkadot-and-stake-with-ledger-live)
to learn how to use {{ polkadot: Polkadot :polkadot }}{{ kusama: Kusama :kusama }} with ledger live.

## Ledger Developer Release

:::warning

This section is for developers only. It is recommended to install the application from Ledger Live
unless you _know precisely what you're doing_.

:::

### Why you might need the Developer Release

Ledger apps for the {{ polkadot: Polkadot :polkadot }}{{ kusama: Kusama :kusama }} ecosystem are
developed by [Zondax](https://zondax.ch/). When new functionalities are added to the Ledger apps,
they are made available on a developer release for testing purposes. After a successful audit and
review, the apps would be available for download and installation using
[Ledger Live](https://www.ledger.com/ledger-live). As it takes some time for Ledger to audit and
review the release, the app upgrade option may not be available on Ledger Live when the new runtime
is deployed on the network. If this happens, users cannot use Ledger devices to sign transactions.
Suppose you cannot wait a few days until the app passes the Ledger audit, you can install the
developer release from the shell using the latest version published on
[the Zondax GitHub repository](https://github.com/Zondax/ledger-polkadot/releases).

### Install the Developer Release

:::info

See [**this video tutorial**](https://youtu.be/4SyVQrlXZ_Q) to learn how to install the developer
release of your ledger app.

Currently, the developer release can be installed only on the Nano S and S plus devices and can't be
installed on the Nano X.

:::

To install the developer version, make sure you have the latest `pip` version and follow the steps
below:

- Install _ledgerblue_ running the command `python3 -m pip install ledgerblue`.
- Download the developer release from the
  [Zondax GitHub repository](https://github.com/Zondax/ledger-polkadot/releases). The file will be
  named `installer_nanos_plus.sh` or something similar, depending on your ledger device.
- Locate the downloaded shell script and make it executable in your shell by typing the command
  `chmod +x installer_nanos_plus.sh`.
- You can now use the `./installer_nanos_plus.sh --help` command to visualize the available options
  (see below)

![Dev Ledger Help Menu](../assets/ledger-help-menu.png)

- Attach your Ledger Nano (in this case Nano S Plus) to your computer, enter the PIN code, and run
  the command `./installer_nanos_plus.sh load`. Scroll with the right button until you see "Allow
  unsafe manager", left and right press to confirm. You will be asked to confirm the action of
  uninstalling the app and subsequently installing the newer version. After confirming both actions,
  the shell script will install the version on your device. You must insert the PIN code to use the
  device after the installation.
- If you wish to revert the version to the stable release, go to Ledger Live. The app will
  automatically detect the developer release and give the option to install the previous stable
  release.

Besides being user-friendly, Multix provides several benefits:

- When one person creates the multisig account, all the signatories see the multisig account on
  their interface.
- There is no need to pass around the call data to confirm a transaction. Such information is
  retrieved from the chain and displayed to the users.
- Thanks to the power of [pure proxies](../learn/learn-proxies-pure.md#anonymous-proxy-pure-proxy),
  adding and removing signatories or adjusting the threshold is now possible without creating new
  multisigs and Multix provides an intuitive interface to work with pure proxies.

## Astar Network

[Astar](https://astar.network/) is an interoperable smart contracts platform for Polkadot and
Ethereum ecosystems supporting both Wasm and EVM smart contracts. Astar provides native access to
Polkadot and Ethereum through its parachain slot and Layer 2 scaling solution, while also offering
bridges into other major blockchain ecosystems.

Through the [dApp staking](https://docs.astar.network/docs/build/dapp-staking/), Astar offers a
basic income to dApp developers, which allows them to continue building and enhancing their dApps
without a pressing need to apply for grant programs, issue tokens and fundraise to earn money. At
every block, a portion of the rewards goes to dApp staking and is then divided between operators
(developers) and nominators. As a dApp grows in popularity, more members of the community nominate
the dApp, and this, in turn, enables the developers who built the dApp to receive a greater
percentage of the block reward.

### Astar Portal

[Astar Portal](https://portal.astar.network/) is a one-stop-place for interaction with Astar
ecosystem, and an exclusive platform for Astar
[dApp staking](https://docs.astar.network/docs/build/dapp-staking/) — users can
[nominate](https://docs.astar.network/docs/build/dapp-staking/for-stakers/staking/) their
Astar/Shiden tokens on specific dApps they wish to support and get a portion of the rewards
distributed at every block. Portal also allows unbonding, rewards compounding and nomination
transfer.

[![](https://docs.astar.network/assets/images/18_projects-77835c356c399187d0627b5bf7093498.png)](https://portal.astar.network/)

Astar Portal supports Polkadot native accounts (Polkadot.js, Talisman, SubWallet, Clover, Math
Wallet, Hana Wallet, OneKey), Multisig accounts (PolkaSafe) and EVM accounts (MetaMask, Talisman,
SubWallet, Hana Wallet, OneKey).

:::info

The material on this page is based on
[Gavin Wood's talk at Polkadot Decoded 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIB1WeVuJD0).

:::

Understanding what [Polkadot 1.0](./polkadot-v1.md) is about and the philosophy behind it will help
us to envision the future direction of the Polkadot ecosystem toward abstraction and generalization.

## Polkadot as a Computational Resource

Polkadot has been abstracted and generalized beyond what was originally proposed and envisioned in
the [whitepaper](https://polkadot.network/whitepaper/). Polkadot is:

- About [**Blockspace**](./polkadot-v1.md#polkadots-blockspace) (the underlying resources that
  chains need), not chains.
- **A platform to build applications** rather than chains and for people to use those applications.
  Fundamentally, Polkadot is not a platform to host chains, and so far, chains happened to be one
  way to build applications and grow Polkadot's utility.
- **A provider of resilient general-purpose continuation computation**, where the term
  _continuation_ refers to a broad, long-running task that can do something, pause, continue (or do
  something else) later.
- **A multicore computer** where chains that continuously operate in parallel on different cores are
  called [parachains](../learn/learn-parachains.md). Currently, one core is reserved for one chain
  through [slot auction mechanism](../learn/learn-auction.md), although one core can be reserved
  on-demand to multiple chains at different periods (see
  [parathreads](../learn/learn-parathreads.md)). At the time of writing (mid 2023), there are around
  50 cores independently operating in parallel on Polkadot.

From now on _application_ will be used as a general term to describe anything that can use a
Polkadot core to access secure and decentralized computation.

## Summary

If we see Polkadot as a service provider of trustless and resilient computation through cores as
well as secure interoperability between core-powered applications, the future development of
Polkadot can be directed towards the following main changes.

A paradigm shift from:

- being a chain-focused ecosystem where each parachain owned an execution core at all times
  (acquired through fixed parachain slots), which allowed a simple and secure, sharded execution
  environment
- to being an application-focused ecosystem where we remove the assumption that each application
  owns a core, and instead that all cores are a resource to be consumed and used as needed by all
  applications.

Previously, securing a parachain slot was a competitive process through an
[auction mechanism](../learn/learn-auction.md). With coretime rental, there is no need for slot
auctions anymore. Teams can purchase instantaneous coretime or reserve bulk coretime as required.
This greatly decreases the barrier-to-entry for software tinkerers and parachain teams.

On top of those main changes, [agile core usage](#agile-core-usage) and
[coretime allocation](#agile-coretime-allocation) will allow any application to access Polkadot's
computation based on their needs without wasting valuable blockspace. [Accords](#xcm-and-accords)
will improve cross-chain communication and the security guarantees of XCM messages. Finally,
Polkadot will scale by moving on-chain logic into its system parachains, allowing it to have more
bandwidth for the [parachains protocol](../learn/learn-parachains-protocol.md) and accords.

## From Slot Auctions to Coretime Marketplace

The end product of blockchains is [**Blockspace**](./polkadot-v1.md#polkadots-blockspace).
Applications need to access Polkadot's blockspace, and the entry points to blockspace are the cores.
Thus, applications will need to reserve some time on cores or **Coretime** to gain the right to
access Polkadot's secure blockspace and interoperability for a finite period.

Cores must be agile and general: they can change what job they run as easily as a modern CPU. It
follows that the procurement of those cores must be agile as well.

The slot auction mechanism is not agile, creates high entry barriers, and is designed for
long-running single applications (i.e., the original Polkadot vision proposed in the whitepaper).

We depart from the classic lease auctions and propose an agile marketplace for coretime, where
essentially **coretime becomes a commodity that can be tokenized, sold, and traded**. This setup
maximizes the agility of Polkadot and lets the market figure out the best solution needed for
applications to be successful.

Applications can reserve **bulk coretime** and **instantaneous coretime** depending on their needs.
Bulk coretime rental will be a standard rental of coretime through a broker system parachain at a
fixed price for a fixed period of time. Instantaneous coretime rental will be available through
ongoing sale of coretime for immediate use at a spot price. This system lowers the barrier to entry
for prospective builders.

For example, revenues from coretime sales can be burnt, used to fund the Treasury, or used for a mix
of those options. The topic is currently under discussion. For more information, see
[RFC-0010](https://github.com/polkadot-fellows/RFCs/pull/10) and
[RFC-0015](https://github.com/polkadot-fellows/RFCs/pull/17/files).

## From Chain- to Application-centricity

Polkadot 1.0 was a chain-centric paradigm consisting of isolated chains able to exchange messages.
This was not fundamentally different from having completely different chains connected to bridges,
with the only difference of having the relay-chain securing the network, providing message-passing
capability, and doing some extra tasks such as [crowdloans](../learn/learn-crowdloans.md),
[auctions](../learn/learn-auction.md), [staking](../learn/learn-staking.md),
[accounts](./learn-accounts-index), [balances](../learn/learn-balance-transfers.md), and
[governance](../learn/learn-polkadot-opengov.md). Having a chain-centric system will ultimately end
in chain-centric application and UX.

The true innovation of Polkadot is about leveraging the unique value proposition offered by
different chains and using those chains’ collaborative potential to build inter-chain applications
to solve real-world problems. Those applications will thus need to span across chains.

**Increasingly fewer tasks will be handled by the relay-chain** that will focus efforts only on
primary tasks: securing the network and providing secure message-passing capability.
[System parachains](../learn/learn-system-chains.md) will be used to take over secondary relay-chain
tasks such as staking, governance, etc.

### XCM and Accords

[XCMP](../learn/learn-xcm.md) is the transport layer for delivering XCM messages. It gives the
transportation method and a secure route but not a framework for binding agreements.

[XCM](../learn/learn-xcm-transport.md) is a format, a language of intention abstract over
functionality common within chains. It creates an expressive language of what you intend to do or
want to happen. XCM messages are transported between different chains using XCMP. Ideally, in a
fully trustless environment, strong guarantees ensure chains faithfully interpret XCM messages. We
can have a secure mode of delivering messages that can be interpreted across protocols, but still
messages might be misinterpreted. These guarantees can be achieved with accords.

An **Accord** is an _opt-in_ treaty across many chains, where treaty logic cannot be changed or
undermined by one or more of those chains, and Polkadot guarantees faithful execution of this logic.
Accords will be specific to a particular function, and any chain that enters the accord will be held
to it and will service that particular function. To lower the entry barrier, accords can be proposed
permissionlessly, but because they are opt-in, the accord proposal will take effect until chains
agree and sign up.

To sum up, accords ensure that the receiver faithfully interprets XCM messages securely sent via
XCMP channels. Accords are the missing piece of the puzzle to achieve a fully trustless and
collaborative environment between applications.

Polkadot is the only ecosystem where accords can properly exist because it has a homogenous security
layer that provides a specific state transition function for each logic component. This allows
patterns of cooperation between multiple logic components (i.e., trans-applications) that would not
be possible to achieve over bridges.

Accords will be implemented using [SPREE technology](../learn/learn-spree.md).

## Core Usage in Polkadot 1.0

In Polkadot 1.0, applications produced blocks at a fixed rate of 12 seconds, whether needed or not.
This led to inefficient energy allocation and economic incentives for producing full blocks under
heavy traffic and empty blocks under light traffic.

The figure below shows the core usage for Polkadot 1.0, where the horizontal axis is time, and each
row represents a core. Colors show different parachains, each using one core (i.e., one parachain,
one core formula).

![core-usage-dumb](../assets/core-usage-dumb.png)

The above setup allowed a **simple and secure, sharded execution environment**.

However, to achieve full efficiency, blocks must be produced when needed, and the system must target
full block capacity, lowering the probability of incentivizing validators to build blocks half full
or, worse, empty.

## Agile Coretime Allocation

In Polkadot 1.0, coretime is a fixed two-year period on one specific core. Here, we remove this
limitation and generalize coretime usage to meet different application needs.

### Split Coretime

Owners of coretime can split or trade it. An application A1 can run on core C1 for a finite period
and then another application A2 can run on that core, or application A1 can continue running on
another core C2. Some applications might stop running for some time and resume later on.

![core-usage-agile-rangeSplit](../assets/core-usage-agile-rangeSplit.png)

### Strided Coretime

Ranges can be strided (i.e., applications can take turns on a core) to share costs or decrease block
production rate, for example.

![core-usage-agile-rangeStrided](../assets/core-usage-agile-rangeStrided.png)

### Combined Coretime

An application can be assigned to multiple cores simultaneously. Some applications can have a
permanent core assignment and an intermittent one, for example, in a period of high demand to send
multiple blocks to multiple cores at the same time slot to reduce latency.

![core-usage-agile-combined](../assets/core-usage-agile-combined.png)

## Agile Core Usage

In Polkadot 1.0, one core is assigned to one application (in this case, equivalent to a parachain).
Ideally, core affinity (i.e., which application operates on which core) is unimportant (see below).
Cores do not have any higher friendliness to one application than another.

![core-usage-dumb-noAffinity](../assets/core-usage-dumb-noAffinity.png)

Here, we remove the assumption that each application owns a core and instead that all cores are a
resource to be consumed and used as needed by all applications in the ecosystem.

### Compressed Cores

The same core can secure multiple blocks of the same application simultaneously. Combining multiple
application blocks in the same relay chain core will reduce latency at the expense of increased
bandwidth for the fixed price of opening and closing a block.

![core-usage-agile-compressed](../assets/core-usage-agile-compressed.png)

### Shared Cores

Sharing cores with other applications to share costs but with no reduction in latency. Note that
this is different from the [split coretime](#split-coretime) where one core is used by multiple
application at different times to share costs at the expense of higher latency.

![core-usage-agile-shared](../assets/core-usage-agile-shared.png)

## Agile Composable Computer

All the above options of agile [coretime allocation](#agile-coretime-allocation) and
[core usage](#agile-core-usage) can be composable and enable the creation of an agile decentralized
global computing system.

![core-usage-agile-composable](../assets/core-usage-agile-composable.png)

Thus, this new vision is focused on Polkadot’s resource, which is secure, flexible, and available
blockspace that can be accessed by reserving some time on a core. Agility in allocating coretime and
using cores allows for maximized network efficiency and blockspace usage.

## Polkadot's Resilience

Systems that have yet to be engineered with decentralization, cryptography, and game theory in mind,
are breakable and prone to cyber-attacks. Polkadot is basing its resilience on different pillars:

- **Preponderance of light-client usage:** Centralized RPC servers are common but susceptible to
  attack and not trustless decentralized entry points to using blockchain-based applications. Light
  client usage on Polkadot is possible through
  [Smoldot](../build/build-light-clients.md#how-to-use-substrate-connect).
- **Zero-Knowledge (ZK) Primitives:** They can have a problematic effect on censorship and
  centralization as having a big state transition function boiled down to a single proof of correct
  execution is not currently a scaling solution to build resilient systems. However, a library of
  richly featured and high-performance ZK primitives ready for specific use cases is being built.
  The first use-case will be used to improve privacy for on-chain collectives such as
  [the Polkadot Technical Fellowship](../learn/learn-polkadot-opengov.md#the-technical-fellowship).
- **[Sassafras](../learn/learn-sassafras.md) consensus:** New forkless block-production consensus
  algorithm replacing [BABE](../learn/learn-consensus.md#block-production-babe) and where block are
  not produced unless they are expected to be finalized. This will provide several benefits, such
  as:
  - Improved security, parachain performance, and UX from being forkless
  - Preventing front-running attacks through high-performance transaction routing where transactions
    are included in blocks in one hop instead of being gossiped, and transaction encryption.
- **Internode Mixnet:** Shielded transport for short messages that
  - avoids leaking IP information for transactions, and
  - introduces a general messaging system allowing users, chains and off-chain workers, smart
    contracts, pallets, and anything else existing within a chain to exchange messages containing
    signatures, intentions, etc.
- **Social Decentralization:** Resilience is achieved by including many participants contributing to
  the system and coming to decisions through on-chain governance. Involving as many people as
  possible ensures resilience against spending becoming systemically misjudged and appropriately
  directs wealth for spending treasury funds, salaries, and grants. Another crucial way of
  decentralizing the network is ensuring experts on which the maintenance of the system relies upon
  are incentivized and recruited over time by the Polkadot network and not by organizations within
  the Polkadot ecosystem.

Since the release of Bitcoin in 2009, blockchain projects increased exponentially to the order of
tens of thousands. Different projects have different value propositions, suggesting that the future
will be multi-chain and that inter-chain communication will be crucial to establish collaborations
and leveraging each other strengths.

## Polkadot 1.0

Polkadot 1.0 reflects the status of Polkadot in 2023 at time of the release of the
[Polkadot runtime v1.0.0](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot/releases/tag/v1.0.0). This sections
focuses on Polkadot 1.0 and some philosophical digressions about network resilience and blockspace.

Polkadot is a Layer-0 blockchain that brings to the multi-chain vision the following innovations and
initiatives:

- **Application-specific Layer-1 (L1) blockchains (or parachains).** Polkadot is a sharded network
  where transactions are processed in parallel with each shard. Polkadot shards can be heterogenous
  (i.e. they do not need the same state transition function as in the proposed Ethereum sharding
  architecture). This allows to build L1 chains designed explicitly around their application and
  value proposition.
- **Shared security and financial scalability of L1 chains**. Any L1 chain attached to a Polkadot
  core can benefit from Polkadot shared security model. This means the Polkadot
  Nominated-Proof-of-Stake (NPoS) mechanism along with its consensus mechanism, will secure L1
  chains out-of-the-box without having to bootstrap security on their own.
- **Secure interoperability.** Any L1 chain attached to Polkadot (as well as L2 chains built on top
  of them) can benefit from Polkadot's native interoperability and will thus be able to communicate
  and exchange value and information with other parachains.
- **Truly resilient infrastructure.** This is achieved by keeping the network decentralized without
  compromising scalability and throughput and through on-chain treasury funds that can be accessed
  through governance referendum. Those funds guarantee constant sponsorship for events, initiatives,
  educational material, education, software development, etc.
- **Fast development and deployment of L1 chains.** This is achieved through the modular and
  flexible [Polkadot SDK Substrate](./glossary.md#substrate).
- **Fostering next-gen of Web3 core developers.** This is achieved through different initiatives
  such as:
  - [The Polkadot Blockchain Academy](https://polkadot.network/development/academy/)
  - [Substrate Builders Program](./builders-program.md)
  - [Polkadot Developer Heroes Program](./dev-heroes.md)
  - [Edx Courses](https://www.edx.org/school/web3x)
  - Rust and Substrate Courses (coming soon)

### Polkadot's Representation

Polkadot has a Relay Chain acting as the main chain of the system. The Polkadot relay chain has been
represented as a ring surrounded by multiple parachains attached to it. Based on Polkadot's design,
as long as a chain's logic can compile to Wasm and adheres to the Relay Chain API, then it can
connect to the Polkadot network as a parachain.

![polkadot-relay-chain](../assets/polkadot_relay_chain.png)

Parachains construct and propose blocks to validators on the Relay Chain, where the blocks undergo
rigorous [availability and validity](../learn/learn-parachains-protocol.md) checks before being
added to the finalized chain. As the Relay Chain provides the security guarantees,
[collators](../learn/learn-collator.md) - full nodes of these parachains - don't have any security
responsibilities, and thus do not require a robust incentive system. This is how the entire network
stays up to date with the many transactions that take place.

The [Cross-Consensus Messaging Format (XCM)](../learn/learn-xcm.md) allows parachains to send
messages of any type to each other. The shared security and validation logic of the Relay Chain
provide the environment for trust-free message passing that opens up true interoperability.

In order to interact with chains that want to use their own finalization process (e.g. Bitcoin),
Polkadot has [bridge parachains](../learn/learn-bridges.md) that offer two-way compatibility,
meaning that transactions can be made between different parachains.

### Polkadot's Additional Functionalities

The Polkadot relay-chain also manges [crowdloans](../learn/learn-crowdloans.md),
[auctions](../learn/learn-auction.md), [staking](../learn/learn-staking.md),
[accounts](./learn-accounts-index), [balances](../learn/learn-balance-transfers.md), and
[governance](../learn/learn-polkadot-opengov.md). Parachain slots or cores are leased in 6-month
chunks for a maximum of two years, and crowdloans allow users to trustlessly loan funds to teams for
lease deposits in exchange for pre-sale tokens. There is no other way you could use Polkadot 1.0.

### Polkadot's Resilience

Decentralization is a crucial aspect of blockchain networks, but there is a trade-off between:

- having an over-decentralized network that struggles to reach consensus and consumes a lot of
  energy to operate, and
- having a network that reaches consensus fast at the expense of being centralized, making it
  trivial to manipulate or attack.

Ideally, a network should be decentralized "enough" to make it practically impossible for someone to
exert manipulative or malicious influence on the network. So, **decentralization is a tool while the
goal is resilience**, which is achieved by additionally providing on-chain treasury and governance
mechanism allowing continuous incentives for the network's participants without relying on
intermediaries or centralized entities.

Currently, Polkadot 1.0 achieve resilience through the following strategies:

- Nominated Proof of Staking (NPoS) where the stake per validator is maximized and evenly
  distributed across validators.
- The [1KV program](./thousand-validators.md) aims to incentivize new operators to become network
  participants and further increase physical (how many validator nodes per service provider) and
  social decentralization (how many validator nodes per operator). Those can be explored with the
  [Polkawatch App](https://polkadot.polkawatch.app/).
- An on-chain treasury and governance (see: [OpenGov](../learn/learn-polkadot-opengov.md) where
  every decision goes though public referenda and any token holder can cast a vote.

### Polkadot's Blockspace

The design and realization of Polkadot 1.0 allowed its creators to enable commoditization of
blockspace.

A blockchain is a way to store data. The storage unit is the block, and once a block is finalized
onto the chain, it is practically impossible to modify the data within that block. In addition to
being tamper-proof, public permissionless blockchains like Polkadot store data that are visible to
everybody (i.e. public), and anybody can become a network participant permissionlessly.

**Blockspace** is the capacity of a blockchain to finalize and commit operations. It represents a
blockchain's security, computing, and storage capability as an end product. Blockspace produced by
different blockchains can vary in security, flexibility, and availability.

- **Security**, intended as how secure the blockspace is. In Proof-of-Stake (PoS) networks, this is
  directly related to how much stake is locked on validator nodes, how much variance in stake there
  is between validators (i.e. how easy it is to attack a single validator), and how many validators
  there are securing the network (i.e. how easy it is for colluding validators to exert influence on
  the network). Additionally, it is also important to look at how many validators are owned by
  single operators (this will determine the degree of social centralization of the network), and how
  many validators run on the same service provider (this will determine the degree of physical
  centralization of the network).
- **Flexibility**, intended as how flexible the blockspace is, what can be done with it, and what
  type of data can be stored. Data quality plays an important role depending on the type of network.
  One might avoid having situations in which poor quality data flood blockspace hindering the prompt
  execution of vital processes.
- **Availability**, intended as how available blockspace is and how difficult it is to access it. It
  should not be too difficult to get your hands on it so that any business model can thrive using
  it. Ideally, a marketplace must drive the blockspace price based on demand, with secondary market
  options to ensure the usage of "second-hand" blockspace.

Polkadot has been designed around those core blockspace principles. However, its design can be
further improved such that the tasks which are currently managed on the relay chain, such as
balances transfers, staking, and governance, can be delegated to
[system parachains](../learn/learn-system-chains.md) to increase flexibility and to focus the use of
the relay-chain to provide shared security and interoperability. Blockspace is only accessible
through slot auctions, but an auction winner has access to a "freighter of blocks" regardless it is
needed or not. This creates high entry barriers and it can lead to waste of energy and resources.

For more information about blockspace the [this interview](https://youtu.be/e1vISppPwe4) to Robert
Habermeier as well as [this article](https://www.rob.tech/polkadot-blockspace-over-blockchains/) by
him.

### A Perspective Shift: Upcoming Polkadot Features

As with many other projects before Polkadot, at some point in time after achieving the
initially-planned goals, a perspective shift allows you to understand better what your project is
about and what you actually have built. This allows you to "run the extra mile" and achieve more
than what was originally planned.

The quote below by [Marcel Proust](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marcel_Proust) must remind us that
sometimes a perspective shift is crucial in _understanding_ the world, and perhaps it is more
important than _seeing more_ of the world.

_The only true voyage of discovery, the only fountain of Eternal Youth, would be not to visit
strange lands but to possess other eyes._

Thus, if we start to see Polkadot with _other eyes_ we can truly envision its potential and what it
could become.

Polkadot is perfecting its implementation through [RFCs](https://github.com/polkadot-fellows/RFCs)
to continue being a decentralized, secure, ubiquitous computing engine to power the next generation
of [Web3](./web3-and-polkadot.md) applications.

:::info Rebranding of Parity Signer to Polkadot Vault

The Polkadot Vault app rebranding is live on
[iOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/parity-signer/id1218174838) and
[Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=io.parity.signer) devices. The source code
of all versions can be downloaded on
[the GitHub repo](https://github.com/paritytech/parity-signer/releases).

The Polkadot Vault app is an air-gapped cold storage solution for all users, including developers
and power users. See [Ledger](./ledger.md) devices for other cold storage solutions.

:::

:::warning Smartphone compatibility with Polkadot Vault

Note that although the Vault app is available for old smartphones, different versions will be
installed according to the phone's hardware. For example, smartphones like iPhone 6 will install
Parity Signer (the old brand name of the Vault app) with limited capabilities. There will be no log
or warning if the phone was connected to the internet while not using the app. Also, no metadata
updates are possible, and no option to add new networks. This would not be as secure as the latest
version of the app. We would recommend that you use smartphones compatible with the latest Polkadot
Vault app.

:::

[![Polkadot Vault Tutorial](https://img.youtube.com/vi/IG_RGLsb2g0/0.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG_RGLsb2g0)

[Polkadot Vault](https://www.parity.io/technologies/signer) (formerly Parity Signer) is a cold
storage solution that allows you to use a phone in airplane mode as an air-gapped wallet. The Vault
app is not technically a wallet, as it does not allow to transfer funds. It is more of a key-chain
tool that will enable you the create, manage, and restore accounts.

By default, the Vault app contains chain specifications for Polkadot, Kusama, and Westend. Metadata
updates are possible via a [QR code fountain](https://metadata.parity.io/#/polkadot). It is also
possible to [add other Substrate-based chains and do metadata updates](#add-chains) for those. The
app allows you to securely sign [extrinsics](../learn/learn-extrinsics.md) via QR codes without
exposing your private keys to the internet.

## Vault vs. Ledger

The Polkadot Vault and [Ledger](./ledger.md) are cold storage solutions because private keys of
accounts created on the Vault app or Ledger device are not stored on your computer or, more in
general, on a device that has an internet connection. However, the two solutions differ, and you
should consider one or the other depending on your user type.

## Create and Import Accounts

You can create a new account directly within the Vault app (Add Key Set > Add new Key Set). This
will generate a new mnemonic seed phrase on the app. Alternatively, you can import a new account in
the app using a seed phrase generated elsewhere with a compatible account generation scheme. For
example, you can have an air-gapped laptop with the Subkey tool installed and generate a new account
there. The seed phrase of that account can be imported into the Vault App (Add Key Set > Recover Key
Set).

For guidelines about how to create an account using Polkadot Vault, see
[**this video tutorial**](https://youtu.be/hgv1R9mPEXw?t=120) and visit
[**this support article**](https://support.polkadot.network/support/solutions/articles/65000180512-how-to-create-an-account-in-parity-signer).

:::info

Importing an account into an extension will not import its private key. Only the public key will be
imported and you must sign using your air-gapped phone which holds the private key.

:::

## Restore Account on Polkadot Vault

See [**this video tutorial**](https://youtu.be/hgv1R9mPEXw?t=407) and
[**this support page**](https://support.polkadot.network/support/solutions/articles/65000167901-how-to-restore-an-account-in-parity-signer)
to learn how to restore your account on the Polkadot Vault app.

## Signing Extrinsics

Remember to always check for metadata updates before signing transactions. See
[this article](https://github.com/w3f/polkadot-wiki/pull/4600/files#diff-5d4d0a286cdc7b1d016ee155f9694dbcddc13f5264490fc1a960c38000baca4d)
to learn how to sign transactions and
[this article](https://support.polkadot.network/support/solutions/articles/65000184128-polkadot-vault-how-to-add-a-new-chain-and-update-the-metadata)
on how to easily add new chains and do metadata updates using the Vault app.

The procedure to sign transactions with the Vault app is as follows:

- The wallet or browser extension will show a QR code encoding the information about what you are
  going to sign.
- After scanning the QR code with the Vault app, you will be presented with decoded information
  about what you will sign. Make sure the information matches what you intended to sign in the first
  place. If something does not feel right, do not sign. Check
  [this page](../learn/learn-extrinsics.md#corrupted-qr-code-parity-signer) for more information and
  contact [the Polkadot Support Team](https://support.polkadot.network/support/home).
- If the information shown by the Vault app is correct, you can present the QR code (signature) to
  the camera on your laptop to sign for the transaction.

:::info QR codes are signature-specific

Note that QR codes are signature-specific. If someone by chance has access to the QR code signature
for one of your transactions, future transactions cannot be signed with that same QR code, and it is
impossible to find out the private key of your account only with that QR code.

:::

## Update the Vault App

:::danger

Ensure you always have your mnemonic seed phrase secure and available.

:::

To securely update the Polkadot Vault app follow the instructions
[here](https://paritytech.github.io/parity-signer/tutorials/Upgrading.html). Briefly,

- backup your accounts (Backup key Set > write down the mnemonic seed phrase),
- factory reset your Vault app (Settings > Wipe all Data),
- factory reset your phone,
- re-install the Vault app,
- go offline (airplane mode, no wifi),
- recover your accounts (Add Key Set > Recover Key Set).

## Security Notes

:::info Remove SIM cards and Forget Networks

To avoid unintended connection of your phone to the Internet, remove SIM cards, reset eSIM settings,
and forget any added WiFi networks. In this way, the only possibility of having an unintended
internet connection is either through the cellular network or through WiFi connection.

:::

The Vault app has a Log that will tell you all activities performed with it. It is important to mark
down the last action, you did so that you can do a security check the next time you use the app.
Also, the Vault app will always tell you if the phone has been (even briefly) connected to the
Internet. In case of an unrecognized connection, it is recommended to:

- Backup your accounts (i.e. make sure you have the mnemonic seed phrases)
- Follow the steps in [Update the Vault app](#update-the-vault-app)
- Once offline, create a new account on the Vault app
- Import the compromised accounts and transfer the funds to the new non-compromised account.

:::danger The Vault App has the option to export private keys

If an account's private key has been exported from the Vault app, the public key will be marked as
"hot" and the following message will be displayed _This key is marked hot because its root private
key has been exported_.

:::

You might consider exporting the private key if you are switching air-gapped phone. If you choose to
export your private key, avoid the following:

- Do not export your private key to a device that is connected to the internet, as your key will not
  be "cold" anymore.
- Do not print private keys QR codes over an internet connection.

## Add Chains

The Vault app contains default chain specs for Polkadot, Kusama, and Westend. It is possible to add
more chains via QR-code, and update their metadata by generating your own QR-code fountain in a
metadata portal similar to that [signed by Parity](https://metadata.parity.io/#/polkadot).
Alternatively, you can use a third-party provider to add chains and their metadata. Check
[this article](https://support.polkadot.network/support/solutions/articles/65000184128-polkadot-vault-how-to-add-a-new-chain-and-update-the-metadata)
for detailed instructions. If you choose this approach, you should trust the provider you choose.

:::info A Wallet for Developers and Power Users

If you need help using the Polkadot-JS UI, you can contact the
[**Polkadot Support Team**](https://support.polkadot.network/support/home). Please note that this
wallet is oriented toward developers and power users. Check out treasury-funded wallets on the
[Wallets Page](./wallets-and-extensions.md) for more user-friendly wallets.

:::

The [**Polkadot-JS UI**](https://polkadot.js.org/apps/#/explorer) is the native application for
accessing all features available on Substrate chains as Polkadot and Kusama. The UI is one of the
moving parts of [**Polkadot-JS tool collection**](./polkadotjs.md), and its functionalities go
beyond normal wallet functionalities such as transfers.

> Note that the UI may not precisely align with the functionality of individual parachains. For more
> information see the [**Polkadot-JS Page**](./polkadotjs.md#polkadot-js-api).

## Main Functionalities

Here we describe those functionalities that will likely be useful to most users. Those
functionalities include account generation, balance transfers, and staking.

### Accounts

In this section of the UI, you can see accounts injected from a browser extension, such as the
[**Polkadot-JS Extension**](./polkadotjs.md#polkadot-js-extension) or
[**other in-browser wallets**](./wallets-and-extensions.md#browser-extensions). It is also possible
to expand balance details and see different
[**account balance types**](../learn/learn-accounts.md#account-balance-types). You can also:

- Add an account (this option must be enabled under [Settings](#settings)). Note that if you clear
  the cache of your browser, you will lose it, and you will need to recover it through seed phrase
  or JSON file.
- Recover and account from JSON file.
- Add an account from QR code.
- Add an account from a [**Ledger**](./ledger.md) device (this option must be enabled under
  [Settings](#settings)).
- Create a [**multi-signature account**](../learn/learn-account-multisig.md).
- Add a proxied account (see
  [**Pure Proxies**](../learn/learn-proxies-pure.md#anonymous-proxy-pure-proxy) for more
  information).

For each account visible in the UI, you can perform different actions, including
[**adding a proxy**](../learn/learn-proxies.md),
[**setting an identity**](../learn/learn-identity.md), and
[**sending tokens**](../learn/learn-balance-transfers.md).

For more information about adding and recovering accounts, see the
[**Account Generation**](../learn/learn-accounts.md#account-generation) page.

### Network (Staking)

In this section of the UI, you can participate in [**staking**](../learn/learn-staking.md). In the
Staking menu you can access:

- The **Overview** tab showing active or waiting validators.
- The **Accounts** tab (visible only if you added an account) showing accounts that are currently
  used for staking
  ([**stash and staking proxy**](../learn/learn-staking.md#stash-account-and-staking-proxy)), bonded
  amount, and nominations. In this tab, you can do staking-related transactions such as bonding more
  funds or changing nominations. If you have
  [**staking proxies**](../learn/learn-staking-advanced.md#staking-proxies) here, you can use them
  while signing for staking-related transactions.
- The **Payouts** tab (visible only if you added an account) showing any pending rewards that still
  need to be paid out to you.
- The **Pool** tab showing all registered [**nomination pool**](../learn/learn-nomination-pools.md)
  with the respective state (open, blocked, or destroying). This tab can also be used to create and
  join a pool.
- The **Targets** tab showing detailed information about validators such as commission and return.
  More information can be found in the [**Nominator Page**](../learn/learn-nominator.md).
- The **Bags** tab (visible only if you added an account) showing the bag you are in ("My bags") and
  all bags within the [**bags list**](../learn/learn-staking-advanced.md#bags-list). Here (if
  applicable), you can rebag accounts that do not belong to the bag you are in, and you can move
  your account in front of the account having less stake than you.
- The **Slashes** tab showing if there are any global slashes.
- The **Validator stats** tab showing statistics for a chosen validator.

### Settings

In this UI section, you can change general settings such as appearance and language. You can also:

- Allow local in-browser account storage. This is used to add accounts directly in the UI (which
  differs from having an account injected from a browser extension).
- Choose to attach Ledger devices. This adds an account directly in the UI from a Ledger device.

Under Settings you can also do the metadata update. Usually, if there is an update, this will be
shown as a notification. For more information about metadata updates, see the
[**dedicated section**](../learn/learn-extrinsics.md#metadata-updates).

## Other Functionalities

In this section, we describe those functionalities that will less likely interest the average user.

### Network

In addition to staking, in the Network section, you can also:

- See the Explorer with the most recent blocks and events.
- Inspect [**parachains**](../learn/learn-parachains.md), see parachain
  [**auctions**](../learn/learn-auction.md) and participate to parachain
  [**crowdloans**](../learn/learn-crowdloans.md).

### Governance

In this section of the UI, you can participate in
[**governance**](../learn/learn-polkadot-opengov.md).

### Developer

In this section of the UI, you can access advanced features such as:

- [Query on-chain data](https://polkadot.js.org/apps/#/chainstate)
- [Query the node using RPC calls](https://polkadot.js.org/apps/#/rpc)
- Call [**extrinsics**](../learn/learn-extrinsics.md) using your account (you are able to see this
  option only if you have an account in the UI)

The [Extrinsic tab](https://polkadot.js.org/apps/#/extrinsics) provides the use to access more
granular functions such as
[**pure proxies**](../learn/learn-proxies-pure.md#anonymous-proxy-pure-proxy) and
[**time-delayed proxies**](../learn/learn-proxies.md#time-delayed-proxy), change
[**nomination pool**](../learn/learn-nomination-pools.md) settings (nomination and roles) and use
[**non-transfer proxies**](../learn/learn-proxies.md#non-transfer-proxy),
[**destroy assets**](../learn/learn-assets.md#destroying-an-asset), and much more.

[**Polkadot-JS**](https://polkadot.js.org/) is a collection of tools that interfaces with the
{{ polkadot: Polkadot :polkadot }}{{ kusama: Kusama :kusama }} blockchain in a granular way. Below
we describe the different components of Polkadot-JS. For more information about Polkadot-JS you can
consult the [**official documentation**](https://polkadot.js.org/docs/).

## Polkadot-JS UI

:::info For Developers and Power Users Only

Please note that this wallet UI is oriented toward developers and power users. Explore Polkadot with
a secure and user-friendly wallets listed on the
[Polkadot website](https://www.polkadot.network/ecosystem/wallets/). If you need help using the
Polkadot-JS UI you can contact the
[**Polkadot Support Team**](https://support.polkadot.network/support/home).

:::

The Polkadot-JS UI is an application that loads in your browser. There is a standard DNS
[**hosted version**](https://polkadot.js.org/), which always has the latest features, and an
[**IPFS version**](https://dotapps.io/) that is less frequently updated but is more decentralized.
This is also often referred to as Polkadot-JS Apps, UI or the Apps UI. In the Wiki pages we will
always refer to Polkadot-JS UI.

Polkadot-JS Apps has many capabilities that go beyond basic wallet functions such as account
creation and sending or receiving transactions. See the [**dedicated section**](./polkadotjs-ui.md)
for more information about the UI.

### Polkadot-JS UI Desktop App

The Polkadot-JS UI also exists as a
[**desktop application**](https://github.com/polkadot-js/apps/releases/) for Windows, Mac and Linux.
The main advantage of using it is that by default it stores encrypted accounts on the filesystem
instead of browser's local storage. Local storage is susceptible to attacks using XSS (Cross-Site
Scripting). There's no such risk when with files stored on disk.

The desktop app uses the [**Electron**](https://www.electronjs.org/) framework. It provides the same
features as web app, the only difference being different account storage.

:::info Ledger not supported

The desktop application does not support Ledger accounts. If you need a cold storage solution you
can try Parity Signer (aka Polkadot Vault).

:::

## Polkadot-JS Extension

The [**Polkadot-JS browser extension**](https://polkadot.js.org/extension/) is not a wallet _per se_
but an account management tool. It allows you to create accounts and also import accounts from
[**Ledger**](./ledger.md) devices or Parity Signer, allowing the signing of
[**extrinsics**](../learn/learn-extrinsics.md) using these accounts. It also allows you export
existing accounts and restore accounts (given you have the required information to restore them).

The extension is a robust key storage tool, i.e. even if you clear the cache of your browser your
accounts will be retained. The extension will recognize any websites that have been flagged for
malicious activity. For additional security, the extension will always ask if you want a specific
website to access the account information on it.

The extension does not let users interact directly with on-chain functions as one would find on a
wallet app like Metamask, i.e. it does not allow you to transact or do anything else other than
adding and managing accounts. However, it provides a simple interface for interacting with
extension-compliant dApps such as the [**Polkadot-JS UI**](https://polkadot.js.org/apps/#/explorer)
and the [**Polkadot Staking Dashboard**](https://staking.polkadot.network/#/overview). Check
[wallets and extensions](./wallets-and-extensions.md) page for wallets that are capable of
transacting on-chain directly.

:::info Metadata Updates

The browser extension is a tool that interacts with the Polkadot network, but it is disconnected
from it when it is not in use. It is important you
[**always check for metadata updates**](../learn/learn-extrinsics.md#metadata-updates) before using
the extension or other account management tools such as Parity Signer (aka Polkadot Vault).

:::

## Polkadot-JS Phishing List

The [**Polkadot-JS phishing list**](https://polkadot.js.org/phishing/) website is a community-driven
curation of malicious actors and operators. The Polkadot-JS extension uses this list to warn a user
about suspicious URLs and addresses that are part of the list, and automatically blocks the account
address.

## Polkadot-JS API

The [**Polkadot-JS API**](https://github.com/polkadot-js/api) is a JavaScript API allowing for
programs to interface with the functionalities of
{{ polkadot: Polkadot. :polkadot }}{{ kusama: Kusama. :kusama }}

While interacting with the underlying
[**@polkadot/api**](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@polkadot/api), most interfaces are generated
automatically when connecting to an available node. This is quite a departure from many other API
designs where the interfaces are commonly static.

When the API connects to a node, it initially retrieves the
[**metadata**](https://polkadot.js.org/apps/#/runtime) which is used to "decorate" the API based on
its contents. The metadata provides data in the form of `api.<type>.<module>.<section>` where `type`
fits into one of the following categories:

- `consts` - runtime constants (these are not functions so the values are returned directly as they
  are defined by the endpoint)
- `query` - chain state values
- `tx` - all extrinsics

The metadata also provides information on
[**events**](https://polkadot.js.org/docs/substrate/events/), which can be queried using the
`api.query.system.events()` interface.

None of the information contained within the `api.{consts, query, tx}.<module>.<method>` endpoints
are hard-coded in the API. These values are defined by the decoration applied from the initial
metadata response and are therefore completely dynamic. This suggests that when you connect to
different parachains, the metadata and API decoration will change and provide varying interfaces
based on the chain.

A developer can use Polkadot-JS Apps to test code's functionality. Interacting with the Polkadot-JS
comes down to either [**querying on-chain data**](#querying-on-chain-data) or
[**issuing an extrinsic**](#issuing-extrinsics).

### Querying On-chain Data

To populate the Apps UI, the web app queries the Polkadot-JS API. The API then queries a
{{ polkadot: Polkadot :polkadot }}{{ kusama: Kusama :kusama }} node and uses JavaScript to return
information that the UI will display on the screen. You can choose which node to connect to by
changing it in the upper-left-hand corner of the screen.

Let's see how we can query on-chain data with Polkadot-JS UI on the Polkadot network with an
example. To find out the current value for existential deposit, navigate to Developer > Chain
state > Constants and query the balances pallet for existential deposit as shown in the snapshot
below. You need to click on the plus button to execute the query. The value displayed is in
[plancks](learn-DOT#polkadot)

![query chain state](../assets/chain-state-constant.png)

### Issuing Extrinsics

Extrinsics are pieces of information that come from outside the chain and are included in a block.
Extrinsics can be one of three types: inherents, signed, and unsigned transactions.

Most extrinsics displayed on Polkadot-JS Apps are signed transactions. Inherits are non-signed and
non-gossiped pieces of information included in blocks by the block author, such as timestamps, which
are “true” because a sufficient number of validators have agreed about validity.

Unsigned transactions are information that does not require a signature but will require some sort
of spam prevention, whereas signed transactions are issued by the originator account of a
transaction which contains a signature of that account, which will be subject to a fee to include it
on the chain.

Scams are an unfortuante reality of the crypto industry. It's important to stay alert and protect
yourself and your non-refundable crypto assets from scammers. If you ever feel you are being
scammed, please get in contact with [Polkadot Support](https://support.polkadot.network).

## DISCLAIMER: Key Security

The _only_ ways to access your account are via your secret seed or your account's JSON file in
combination with a password. Keep them offline in a secure and private location. If you share these
with anyone, they can access your account, including your funds. This information is always a target
for hackers and malicious actors. Check out the wiki doc on
[how to recognize scams](../general/scams.md).

[![Account Creation Tutorial](https://img.youtube.com/vi/ARsdXZycJAg/0.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ARsdXZycJAg)

:::info

Visit
[this support article](https://support.polkadot.network/support/solutions/articles/65000181874-how-to-store-your-mnemonic-phrase-and-backup-file-safely)
for more information about key security.

:::

## Essential Rules

1. Never, ever, ever share your seed phrase or account password.
2. Do not trust anyone online. It is trivial for them to lie and change their identities.
3. [If you are scammed](#i-got-scammed---what-can-i-do), there is **likely nothing** that can be
   done to recover your funds. If a scammer gets a hold of your seed phrase, they can transfer all
   of your funds to their account in seconds. It is better to be safe than to risk all of your
   tokens.
4. If it sounds too good to be true, it probably is. People, especially celebrities, do not give
   away crypto for free. Even if they wanted to, they could just ask for your address as opposed to
   having you send them tokens.
5. Scams are absolutely rife in this space. It is easy and cheap to set a scam up, and hard to shut
   one down. Therefore, the onus is on the user to be as diligent as possible in avoiding them.
6. If you can, try to always verify new information that you see with an official source, such as
   [Polkadot network's official blog](../general/community.md) or
   [Polkadot's Official Support](https://support.polkadot.network). Often scammers will fake a
   website or a blog post, but if you check it against a secondary source you will reduce the
   chances of being scammed.

   :::caution

   With crowdloans active on the network, it is very important to know how to safely participate.
   Fake crowdloan campaigns may present an attractive target for scammers. If you are participating
   in a network-native crowdloan, **never send your tokens to an address.** Native crowdloan
   contributions are made with a special transaction using a campaign index, where the contributed
   assets remain locked until the end of the lease period. Legitimate teams will not ask you to send
   your assets to an address to participate in a network-native crowdloan.

   :::

### Some Common Types of Scams

- Private messages sent to you over Telegram, Twitter, and other social media - admins or employees
  will never contact you.
- "Giveaways" advertising that you "send us some DOT/KSM, we'll send you double back".
- Sites where you need to enter your seed phrase in order to "sync" your account, claim tokens,
  unblock transactions etc.
- Emails asking for DOT/KSM private keys/seeds/etc., posing as a member of any of our teams.
- Scammers will take official videos, add "giveaway" text around it so that it looks like the
  giveaway is supported by Polkadot, Kusama, Web3 Foundation, Parity, or another well-known entity.
- Many scammers will create nearly perfect imitations of sites - always triple-check the URL.
- People offering to help you stake or get rewards.
- People responding to questions that you asked publicly in a private chat.
- Advertisements pointing to imitations of sites asking you to enter your seed words.

These are just some of the types of scams. Scammers are inventing new ones all the time. In general,
do not trust anyone messaging you that you did not message yourself, and be wary of anyone
attempting to help you or offer you a "deal".

Scammers will often imitate usernames, profile pictures, etc. of well-known members of the
community. Often the differences in these accounts will be very minor, such as `joe_sm1th` or
`jo_smith` instead of `joe_smith`.

Scammers will often make it seem like the "deal" is only available for a limited time. Do not be
tricked by this, it is always better to confirm than to risk losing everything.

### Admins will never contact you directly

If you've received a message from an admin over Telegram, ignore it. Our team members will never
personally message you. Our social media accounts are posted on our website and any new social media
accounts will be announced by our team. We will never offer to sell you DOT at a discount, air-drop
"rewards", or message you privately to help with a problem you posted publicly. Our social media can
be found below:

- [Twitter](https://twitter.com/Polkadot)
- [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/polkadot)
- [Discord](https://dot.li/discord)
- [Polkadot YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCB7PbjuZLEba_znc7mEGNgw)
- [Polkadot Medium](https://medium.com/polkadot-network)
- [Our Community Page](../general/community.md) also lists more social media accounts that Web3
  Foundation, Polkadot, and Kusama have.

### Keep your data secure

You should _never_ share your seed phrase, password, private keys, or any other personal data with
anyone. If you are concerned a wallet could be fake, please check out our list of well-known
[wallets](./wallets).

Some simple things that you can do to keep your assets and information secure from hackers:

- Keep your seed phrase only on paper, in a secret and secure location.
- DO NOT keep your seed phrase on any electronic medium, like the cloud, on your computer, on a USB
  drive, etc.
- Never enter your seed or mnemonic phrase directly into a website.
- Your seed phrase is meant as a backup in case you lose access to your wallet. Use it only for that
  purpose and only in wallets you've used before and trust.
- Your passwords should be strong and unique. It is recommended that you use a
  [password manager app](https://www.howtogeek.com/141500/why-you-should-use-a-password-manager-and-how-to-get-started/)
  to create and store your passwords.
- Keep your computer free of malware. Although an antivirus can be of great help, it's not a
  panacea. Safe browsing and downloading is the only way to be sure your computer is clean.
- Avoid installing browser extensions from sources you don't trust explicitly.
- Store your assets in cold storage, like a hardware wallet or
  [Parity Signer](https://www.parity.io/signer/).

### Always check the source

For any potential scam, always be sure to do a background check on the source, i.e, look at any
username, email, YouTube channel name, URL, etc. If something seems fishy, that's because it likely
is. Never enter any personal data if you feel the source could be a scam. Feel free to check with
[Polkadot's official support](https://support.polkadot.network)..

### Check twice before sending DOT/KSM

A good practice to take into consideration is to verify the address you are sending crypto to. If
you don't know that account, you probably shouldn't be sending your assets there. It's your
responsibility to make sure that you understand where you are sending your funds. Crypto is a
decentralized space and your only recourse if a mistake is made is by appealing to the council (who
usually will not get involved in matters of mistaken transfers - see below).

### Install the Polkadot{.js} extension

The extension uses crowd-sourced [anti-phishing measures](https://polkadot.js.org/phishing/) to
automatically prevent your browser from displaying known phishing or scam sites. They will be
blocked upon loading, helping to prevent you from visiting these sites and thus falling for them.

### Our official sites

You can use the following list of our official domains to make sure that you're visiting an official
site:

- https://polkadot.network
- https://polkadot.io
- https://kusama.network
- https://web3.foundation
- https://parity.io
- https://substrate.io

Of course, many projects building on Polkadot and Kusama that use similar names. If, however, a site
poses as Polkadot, Kusama, Web3 Foundation, or Parity on a domain not listed above, then it's most
likely a scam.

Besides those, there are also `polkadot.js.org` and `dotapps.io` that host our web wallet and other
tools.

## I Got Scammed - What Can I Do?

In the unfortunate case of having fallen for a scam, there is likely nothing that can be done to
recover your funds. However, there is still help and support that you can receive. The Polkadot
Support team stands ready to help you in this difficult situation. Please check this
[Support article](https://support.polkadot.network/support/solutions/articles/65000182668-what-to-do-if-you-fell-victim-to-scam-or-hack)
for steps you should take to **prevent further loss** and contact Polkadot Support from the same
page. Finally, make sure to read the present article carefully to learn how to avoid falling victim
in the future.

## Polkadot Staking Dashboard

The [Polkadot Staking Dashboard](https://staking.polkadot.network/#/overview) is a web3 application
dedicated to native non-custodial [staking](../learn/learn-staking.md) on the
{{ polkadot: Polkadot :polkadot }}{{ kusama: Kusama :kusama }} relay chain. The dashboard allows to
stake as a solo nominator or as a [nomination pool](../learn/learn-nomination-pools.md) member.
Users can also create their nomination pools. The dashboard supports [Ledger](../general/ledger.md),
[Polkadot Vault](../general/polkadot-vault.md),
[SubWallet](../general/wallets-and-extensions.md#subwallet),
[Talisman](../general/wallets-and-extensions.md#talisman), WalletConnect, Fearless Wallet,
PolkaGate, and Enkrypt. The dashboard also supports
[staking proxies](../learn/learn-proxies.md#staking-proxy).

You can find more information about the Polkadot staking dashboard on the dedicated
[wiki page](./staking-dashboard.md) and
[support articles](https://support.polkadot.network/support/solutions/folders/65000157523).

Below a list of video tutorial about the Polkadot Staking Dashboard.

## Sub.ID

[Sub.ID](https://sub.id/) is a one-stop-shop for managing your Polkadot accounts, viewing your
addresses and balances, and looking at other accounts.

[![](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/893485384154095640/1166807359411204228/image.png?ex=654bd508&is=65396008&hm=ddf3dc26f525d0021df4d8879f19973b81040514bfb10423e748d397c7a66329&)](https://sub.id/)

It features a Polkadot [staking page](https://sub.id/validator/polkadot), where you can easily start
staking {{ polkadot: DOT :polkadot }}{{ kusama: KSM :kusama }}. Stakers can choose their preferred
validators or stake with the recommended validator set.

## NOMI

[NOMI](https://apps.turboflakes.io/?app=nomi) is designed to actively involve Nominators in Native
Staking within the {{ polkadot: Polkadot :polkadot }}{{ kusama: Kusama :kusama }} networks. It aims
to offer a unique and enhanced nomination experience, using
[Multiple-Criteria Decision Analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiple-criteria_decision_analysis)
(MCDA) as a base for the analytical research. MCDA is an open and transparent approach for
evaluating numerous conflicting traits in the decision-making process. For the analysis, validator
data is collected at the last block of every session.

## SubWallet Earning

[SubWallet Web Dashboard](https://web.subwallet.app/) is the all-in-one solution to manage assets
and stake on multiple networks in the Polkadot, Kusama and Polkadot SDK (Substrate) ecosystems.

The Web Dashboard features an Earning tab which allows users to stake DOT easily via native
nomination pools, as well as in liquid staking and lending protocols, without having to manage
multiple applications with different interfaces and experiences.

import RPC from "./../../components/RPC-Connection";

:::info Preliminary Notes

The [Polkadot Staking Dashboard](https://staking.polkadot.network/#/overview) supports
[**proxy accounts**](../learn/learn-proxies.md) and you can import your
[staking proxy](../learn/learn-staking-advanced.md#staking-proxies) (for nominators) or
[non-transfer proxy](../learn/learn-proxies.md#non-transfer-proxy) (for nomination pool admins and
members).

The dashboard also has **native [Ledger](./ledger.md) support**, meaning that you do not need an
extension or a wallet to use it; you just need your Ledger device.
[Metadata updates](../learn/learn-extrinsics.md#metadata-updates) are thus not necessary, as you
only need to keep your Ledger apps up-to-date.

Before using the dashboard, make sure you have a
[wallet or extension](./wallets-and-extensions.md#browser-extensions) with a funded
{{ polkadot: Polkadot :polkadot }}{{ kusama: Kusama :kusama }} account. Note that accounts on
wallets or extensions can be imported from [Ledger](./ledger.md) or
[Polkadot Vault](./polkadot-vault.md).

On top of the [existential deposit](../learn/learn-accounts.md#existential-deposit-and-reaping), you
need some free balance to pay for [transaction fees](../learn/learn-transaction-fees.md) and the
minimum amount to place your nominations (only for nominators, currently
{{ polkadot: __<RPC network="polkadot" path="query.staking.minNominatorBond" defaultValue={2500000000000} filter="humanReadable"/>__ :polkadot }}{{ kusama: __<RPC network="kusama" path="query.staking.minNominatorBond" defaultValue={100000000000} filter="humanReadable"/>__ :kusama }})
or join a nomination pool (only for pool members, currently
{{ polkadot: __<RPC network="polkadot" path="query.nominationPools.minJoinBond" defaultValue={10000000000} filter="humanReadable"/>__ :polkadot }}{{ kusama: __<RPC network="kusama" path="query.nominationPools.minJoinBond" defaultValue={1667000000} filter="humanReadable"/>__ :kusama }}).
For more information about staking on {{ polkadot: Polkadot :polkadot }}{{ kusama: Kusama :kusama }}
visit the [staking page](../learn/learn-staking.md) and the
[advanced staking page](../learn/learn-staking-advanced.md).

:::

The [Polkadot Staking Dashboard](https://staking.polkadot.network/#/overview) is a tool only
dedicated to [staking](../learn/learn-staking.md) on Polkadot,
[Kusama](../learn/learn-comparisons-kusama.md) (Polkadot's canary network) and
[Westend](../maintain/maintain-networks.md#westend-test-network) (Polkadot's test network).

The dashboard is not a wallet, meaning that you cannot transfer funds between accounts. To fund
accounts, you can use [wallets and extension](./wallets-and-extensions.md). You can participate in
staking by being a [nominator](../learn/learn-nominator.md) or a member of a
[nomination pool](../learn/learn-nomination-pools.md). Once you have a funded account, you need to
connect it to the dashboard (connect button on the top-right corner), this will allow you to
interact with {{ polkadot: Polkadot's :polkadot }}{{ kusama: Kusama's :kusama }} native staking.

:::info The dashboard is a Web3 dApp

The dashboard is a decentralized application (dApp), and to login you do not need to sign up with an
email and password but just need an account created on the supported non-custodial wallets. Any
transaction to be submitted needs to be signed by you. Also, if you use light clients, which are
resistant to censorship, you interact trustlessly with the network without intermediaries. Welcome
to the world of [true Web3](./web3-and-polkadot.md)!

:::

{{ polkadot: Note the pictures on this page refer to Kusama, but the same applies to Polkadot and Westend. :polkadot }}
The structure of this page follows the sidebar of the staking dashboard. Here you will learn about
the main features of the dashboard. If you need more information, see the
[Walkthrough Tutorial](https://youtu.be/hvXLc4H7rA4).

## Overview

:::info Staking Dashboard Walk-through video tutorial

[This video tutorial](https://youtu.be/hvXLc4H7rA4) shows you everything you can do with the Staking
Dashboard.

:::

![dashboard overview](../assets/dashboard-overview.png)

This page of the dashboard has six main panels:

- **Section A: The Sidebar** shows which page you are on (in this case, the Overview). It will also
  show the role you currently have in staking (in this case, active in both [Pools](#pools) and
  [Nominate](#nominate)). You can also change the [network](#network) (currently on Kusama).

- **Section B: The Accounts Panel** allows you to connect one account to the dashboard. Once
  connected, the account will appear next to the `Accounts` button. You can see it here if you are
  active as a nominator and/or a pool member. In this case, the account KSM Stash is a nominator and
  a member of the pool Insight Finance. Proxy accounts are also shown here if applicable. Note that
  the dashboard will automatically fetch the stash and the proxy.

Note that Sections A and B will always be visible while you use the dashboard.

- **Section C: The Stats Panel** shows the general view of current staking metrics, including the
  historical reward rate (including after
  [inflation](../learn/learn-staking-advanced.md#inflation)), the supply staked and time remaining
  in the current era.

- **Section D: The Summary Panel** shows your current situation and gives you general tips about
  staking. In this case, the KSM Stash account is a nominator and a pool member, and by clicking on
  `Manage >` you can go directly to the [Nominate](#nominate) and [Pools](#pools) pages,
  respectively. You can take actions such as changing staking preferences, bonding more funds, etc.

- **Section E: The Balance Panel** shows the bonded amount distinguishing between "Nominating", "In
  a Pool", and "Not Staking". The amount that is not staking is further divided into "Free" (a
  balance that can be transferred) and "Reserve" (a balance that is needed the keep the account
  on-chain, see [existential deposit](../learn/learn-accounts.md#existential-deposit-and-reaping)).
  In this case, 0.301 KSM are bonded for nominating, 0.3 KSM are bonded in a pool, and 0.145 KSM are
  not used for staking. Of the non-staking balance, 0.144 KSM are free while
  {{ polkadot: <RPC network="kusama" path="consts.balances.existentialDeposit" defaultValue={333000000} filter="humanReadable"/> :polkadot }}{{ kusama: <RPC network="kusama" path="consts.balances.existentialDeposit" defaultValue={333000000} filter="humanReadable"/> :kusama }}
  are reserved for the existential deposit.

- **Section F: The Recent Payouts Panel** shows a bar chart with the rewards paid out to you in the
  past 15 days either as a nominator or a pool member (manually claimed). Note how the 4th of April
  bar has the tip that is not filled with color. This is to show a pending payout (for nominators
  only). Below the bar chart is a line chart showing the 10-day moving average.

Additional statistics can be found at the bottom of the overview page.

:::info Pool funds are in system accounts

Remember that funds bonded in a pool are transferred to the pool's system account, which can only be
accessed by the protocol, and not by any individual user. Some wallets might not display the balance
bonded in pools, but the dashboard will always show it.

:::

## Stake

In this category, you can access all functionalities allowing you to stake your tokens as a
nominator, member of a nomination pool, or both. The payout section will enable you to inspect the
most recently received rewards.

### Pools

:::info Joining a Nomination Pool - Walk-through video tutorial

[This video tutorial](https://youtu.be/dDIG7QAApig) shows you how to join a
[nomination pool](../learn/learn-nomination-pools.md) with the Staking Dashboard. You can also read
the
[dedicated support article](https://support.polkadot.network/support/solutions/articles/65000182376-staking-dashboard-how-to-join-a-nomination-pool)
about joining a pool.

:::

![dashboard pools](../assets/dashboard-pools.png)

This page of the dashboard has four main panels (Sidebar and Accounts Panels excluded):

- **Section A: The Stats Panel** shows the number of active pools and the minimum number of tokens
  needed to join a pool and/or create one.
- **Section B: The Balance Panel** shows the number of tokens bonded in pools and those that are
  free. In this case, we have 0.3 KSM bonded and 0.144 KSM free. In this panel, you can bond more
  funds (`+` button) or unbond some funds (`-` button). Unbonding will withdraw unclaimed rewards
  and funds will be locked for 28 eras
  ({{ polkadot: 28 days :polkadot }}{{ kusama: 7 days :kusama }}). Once the 28 eras have passed, you
  can unlock the locked funds (button with a lock icon) that will be available as a free balance.

:::info No fast unstake and pool swap for pool members

Note that the option to fast unstake is only available to nominators. Also, to change pool, you
cannot simply swap memberships. You will need to unbond and go through the whole unbonding period.

:::

- **Section C: The Pool Panel** shows the pool id where you have membership (in this case, Pool 82),
  the pool name, and next to it, a `Manage` button that will allow to choose between different
  options:

  - Update Claim Permissions: you can allow other pool members to compound your rewards, withdraw
    your rewards as a free balance, or both. More details about nomination pools and updating claim
    permissions can be found on the
    [dedicated wiki page](../learn/learn-nomination-pools.md#claim-permissions).

  ![dashboard-permissionlessPoolClaims](../assets/dashboard-permissionlessPoolClaims.png)

  - Leave the pool and unbond all the funds in the pool.

  If you are a pool admin you will be able to see the additional options:

  - Claim Commission: you can claim pool commissions to an account specified under Manage Commission
    (below).
  - Manage Commission: you can manage the pool commission rate, maximum commission, maximum change
    rate, and minimum time delay between commission updates. More details about nomination pools and
    managing pool commissions can be found on the
    [dedicated wiki page](../learn/learn-nomination-pools.md#pool-commissions).

  For more information about how-to manage commission of your nomination pool with the staking
  dashboard see
  [this support article](https://support.polkadot.network/support/solutions/articles/65000182388-staking-dashboard-how-to-create-a-nomination-pool#Pool-management-options).

  :::

  - Rename Pool: you can change the pool's name.
  - Lock Pool: you can lock the pool so that new members are not allowed.
  - Destroy Pool: you can destroy the pool. See
    [this wiki page](../learn/learn-guides-staking-pools.md#pool-destruction) and
    [this support article](https://support.polkadot.network/support/solutions/articles/65000182388-staking-dashboard-how-to-create-a-nomination-pool#How-to-destroy-a-pool)
    for more information.

  You can see any unclaimed rewards in the middle of the panel. You can claim and bond the rewards
  (`+ Compound` button) or withdraw them as a free balance (`Withdraw` button). In this case, there
  are approximately 0.0012 KSM that can be claimed. You can see the Pool Status at the bottom of the
  panel, currently set to "Nominating and Earning Rewards".

Note that if it is the first time you log in to the dashboard, you will see two
buttons `Create` and `Join`, instead of `Manage`. For more information about how to create a
nomination pool, see
[this support article](https://support.polkadot.network/support/solutions/articles/65000182388-staking-dashboard-how-to-create-a-nomination-pool#How-to-create-a-pool).

- **Section D: The Pool Nominations Panel** shows the nominations of the pool you are currently in,
  highlighting the validator that is active and will pay rewards to the pool at the end of the era
  (in this case `ParaNodes.io/11`).

If you scroll down the page, there are two additional panels:

- **Roles** showing the accounts of the pool's Depositor, Root, Nominator, and Bouncer. The same
  account can cover all the roles.
- **Pool Stats** showing the Pool State (either Active, Closed, or Destroying), Pool Members (number
  of members in the pool), and Total Bonded (total number of bonded tokens).

The Pools page is divided into four parts: the Overview is basically what we talked about until now,
the Members section will show all accounts of the pool members, the All Pools section will show all
pools (you can filter Active, Locked, and Destroying pools), and the Favorites section shows all
pools that you liked (you can like a pool in the All Pools section by clicking on the heart icons).

### Nominate

:::info Walk-through video tutorial of How to Nominate

[This video tutorial](https://youtu.be/F59N3YKYCRs) shows you how to become a nominator with the
Staking Dashboard.

:::

![dashboard nominate](../assets/dashboard-nominate.png)

This page of the dashboard has four main panels (Sidebar and Accounts Panels excluded):

- **Section A: The Stats Panel** shows the number of active nominators, the minimum number of tokens
  to nominate (currently
  {{ polkadot: <RPC network="kusama" path="query.staking.minNominatorBond" defaultValue={100000000000} filter="humanReadable"/> :polkadot }}{{ kusama: <RPC network="kusama" path="query.staking.minNominatorBond" defaultValue={100000000000} filter="humanReadable"/> :kusama }})
  and the minimum active bond (currently
  {{ polkadot: <RPC network="kusama" path="query.staking.minimumActiveStake" defaultValue={2937000000000} filter="humanReadable"/> :polkadot }}{{ kusama: <RPC network="kusama" path="query.staking.minimumActiveStake" defaultValue={2937000000000} filter="humanReadable"/> :kusama }}).
  The system keeps 12500 nomination intents and puts them into the
  [bags list](../learn/learn-staking-advanced.md#bags-list). The fact that active nominators are not
  12500 is because there are nominators that have no active validator.
- **Section B: The Balance Panel** shows the number of tokens bonded in nominations and those that
  are free. In this case, we have 0.301 KSM bonded and 0.144 KSM free. In this panel, you can bond
  more funds (`+` button) or unbond some funds (`-` button). Unbonding will withdraw unclaimed
  rewards and funds will be locked for 28 eras
  ({{ polkadot: 28 days :polkadot }}{{ kusama: 7 days :kusama }}). Once the 28 eras have passed, you
  can unlock the locked funds (button with a lock icon) that will be available as a free balance.

:::info Fast unstake

If your account did not receive rewards in the past 28 eras, you will be eligible for fast unstake.
The dashboard will automatically check this for you and prompt a banner.

:::

- **Section C: The Nominator Panel** shows the current status of the nominator, currently set to
  "Nominating and Earning Rewards", and next to it, the `Unstake` button allows you to unstake the
  whole bonded amount and stop nominating. In the middle of the panel, the payout destination is
  currently set to "Compounding" (i.e. rewards are added to the bonded funds). The `Update` button
  will allow you to change the destination to "To Your Account" (to the stash account as a free
  balance), "To Another Account" (an account that is not the stash), or "None" (no payout
  destination).
- **Section D: The Nominations panel** shows your nominations and allows you to stop all nomination
  with the `Stop` button or to select specific validators (`Select` button) and stop nominating only
  those.

### Payouts

This page is an expanded version of Panel F on the [Overview](#overview) page. It also shows all
validators and/or nomination pools that paid out rewards to your accounts in the past few months.

### After Staking

## Validators

![dashboard nominate](../assets/dashboard-validators.png)

This page of the dashboard has two main panels (Sidebar and Accounts Panels excluded):

- **Panel A: The Stats Panel** shows the total number of active validators, all validators currently
  registered (active and inactive), and average commission across all validators.
- **Panel B: The Validators Panel** shows all validators. You can order them by low/high commission
  or apply the following filters:
  - Include only active validators
  - Exclude validators that are oversubscribed, have 100% commission, blocked nominations, and have
    missing identity.

## Support

The Support pages are:

- The Resources page provides a glossary with main definitions and links to support pages.
- The Feedback page can be used to send feedback through
  [Canny.io](https://polkadot-staking-dashboard.canny.io/feedback). This can be a bug report or a
  feature request. We take your feedback seriously, do not hesitate to contact us.

## Request of Commit (RFC)

With the release of [Polkadot runtime 1.0](./polkadot-v1.md), Polkadot's codebase is in the hands of
the community. Anyone can open a
[Request For Commit (RFC)](https://github.com/polkadot-fellows/RFCs) to propose and discuss changes
to the network protocol, runtime logic, and public interfaces, and other technical matters.

To submit an RFC, follow the instructions [here](https://github.com/polkadot-fellows/RFCs#process).

RFCs can only be approved and merged by III-Dan members of
[Polkadot Technical Fellowship](../learn/learn-polkadot-opengov.md#the-technical-fellowship) via
on-chain voting mechanism. Definitive approval or rejection is done by issuing the
`RFC_APPROVE(xxxx, h)` or `RFC_REJECT(xxxx, h)` on-chain remark from the Fellowship origin on the
Polkadot Collectives parachain, where `xxxx` is the RFC number and `h` is the hash of the raw
proposal text.

For example, the first RFC [RFC-1](https://github.com/polkadot-fellows/RFCs/pull/1) about Agile
Coretime was proposed by Gavin Wood on the 30th of June 2023 and merged on the 12th of August 2023.
Subsequently, the
[code for the Agile Coretime Broker pallet](https://github.com/paritytech/substrate/pull/14568) was
added to the Substrate FRAME system.

description: The Thousand Validators Program and How it can Support your Validator Endeavors.
keywords: [thousand validators programme, validator, validate, maintain, TVP]
slug: ../thousand-validators
---

The Thousand Validators Programme is an initiative by Web3 Foundation and Parity Technologies to use
the funds held by both organizations to nominate validators in the community.

It serves two major purposes:

1. Give validators a structured on-ramp to join the active set of validators on Kusama and Polkadot
2. Further decentralize the validator active set.

## How it Works

The [nominating backend](https://github.com/w3f/1k-validators-be) will routinely change its
nominations at every {{ polkadot: era :polkadot }}{{ kusama: four eras :kusama }}. The backend does
this by short-listing candidates by validity and then sorts validators by their weighted score in
descending order.

- Validators with a higher weighted score are selected for any possible slots. As validators are
  nominated and actively validate, their weighted scores decrease allowing other validators to be
  selected in subsequent rounds of assessment.

- If a validator is active during a single nomination period (the time after a new nomination and
  before the next one) and does not break any of the requirements, it will have its rank increased
  by 1. Validators with higher rank have performed well within the programme for a longer period of
  time.

The backend nominates as many validators as it reasonably can in such a manner to allow each nominee
an opportunity to be elected into the active set.

## Setting up a Validator

Please see the guide on how to
[set up a validator](../maintain/maintain-guides-how-to-validate-polkadot.md) as well as additional
information on how to [secure a validator](../maintain/maintain-guides-secure-validator.md).

## How to Apply

{{ polkadot: **Entrance to the Polkadot programme requires a rank of 25 or higher in the Kusama programme.**

  providers.

#### Nominators

The below addresses are the stash / staking proxy pairs for the primary nominators involved in the
{{ polkadot: Polkadot :polkadot }}{{ kusama: Kusama :kusama }} Thousand Validators programme. They
are formatted like "`stash` / `staking proxy`".

{{ polkadot: - `14Ns6kKbCoka3MS4Hn6b7oRw9fFejG8RH5rq5j63cWUfpPDJ` / `12iz6aJ75KdqVZLGyvFJmgc5k74Pdokgy9UGTgWtnt67RNTg` :polkadot }}

A time delay proxy is used as the interaction method for some of these accounts.

{{ kusama: Within the Kusama programme, there are several other nominator accounts that can exhaustively be determined by parsing data found [here](https://kusama.w3f.community/nominators) :kusama }}

Since approximately early January 2021, the nominators will select an automatic number of validators
to nominate based on the lowest amount staked for a validator and the amount of funds it holds. This
can be anywhere from a few validators receiving nomination from a single nominator, to the max of
{{ polkadot: 16 :polkadot }}{{ kusama: 24 :kusama }} nominators on
{{ polkadot: Polkadot :polkadot }}{{ kusama: Kusama :kusama }}.

## Selection

On-chain parameters assess each candidate to produce a weighted score. It is a changing system in
which new endpoints or scores are sometimes introduced. Below are some of the original weights.

### Weights

#### Inclusion

The inclusion weight accounts for 40 points. It is assessed by an evaluation of the validator's
inclusion in the active set over the past 84 eras. A candidate can be assured of full score if there
were no stints of active validation in 84 eras.

#### Span Inclusion \*

The span inclusion weight accounts for 40 points. It is assessed by an evaluation of the validator's
inclusion in the active set over the past 28 eras. A candidate can be assured of full score if there
were no stints of active validation in 28 eras.

#### Discovered \*

The discovered weight accounts for 5 points. It is determined by comparing the candidates tenure in
the programme relative to other candidates. A candidate that is in the programme for a longer
duration relative to the entire group of validators allows for a higher score.

#### Nominated \*

The nominated weight accounts for 10 points, and it is assessed based on when the candidate was last
nominated relative to the other candidates in the programme.

#### Rank \*

The rank weight accounts for 5 points and is assessed relative to the ranks of other candidates
within the programme.

#### Unclaimed

The unclaimed weight relates to the number of payouts outstanding for greater than
{{ polkadot: four :polkadot }}{{ kusama: sixteen :kusama }} eras. Each payout that exceeds this
threshold would attribute a negative score of 10 points.

#### Bonded \*

Candidates with a bond size that is relatively higher than others would receive a score of 50
points.

#### Faults \*

A fault is attained when a candidate has an offline event when actively validating. A legitimate
fault is irrevocable. Faults account for 5 points in the system and are relative to others in the
programme.

#### Offline time

Candidates who have accumulated < 200 minutes offline time during the weekly period will receive 2
points in the system. Offline time is judged by a candidate's connection to the W3F Telemetry and is
reset on Sundays.

#### Location \*

The system allocates a score of 40 points for candidates who host their validators in uniquely
located data centres. A candidate's location is determined from Telemetry and is relative to the
number of other candidates located at the same data centre.

#### Council

Candidates will receive a score of up to 50 points for voting for council members. Candidates may
back as few as one candidate; to attain a full score of 50 points, the 1KV candidate should
allocate > 75% of their bond to the respective council members.

#### Democracy

Candidates will receive 10 \* 1KV points for each referendum they have voted on (Aye/Nay) to a limit
of 100 points. Scores are based on votes for referendum
{{ polkadot: 49 :polkadot }}{{ kusama: 163 :kusama }} and beyond.

\* Scores that are based on their relative position against others are assessed as follows:

- The respective weight is assigned high and low percentiles. Any scores lower than the score at the
  low percentile and higher than the score at the high percentile are removed.
- The weighted score is then obtained by ((candidate_value - low_threshold) / (high_threshold -
  low_threshold)) \* weight.

* The default low and high percentiles are 10 and 90%, respectively.
* Inclusion and Span Inclusions are measured against low and high percentiles of 20 and 75%,
  respectively.
* Bonded is measured against low and high percentiles of 5 and 85%, respectively.
* Finally, location is measured against low and high percentiles of 10 and 95%, respectively.

## Frequently asked questions

- _How do I apply?_ See [here](#how-to-apply).
- _How long does it take for the application to process?_ Usually a few weeks. Sometimes a little
  longer. You can inspect the candidate files
  [here](https://github.com/w3f/1k-validators-be/tree/master/candidates) and see if your info shows
  up. Also, you will get invited to a dedicated matrix room after being accepted.
- _I'm in the program and am getting nominated but don't get active?_ The system optimizes the
  nominations to maximize the stake on active validators and minimize the stake variance across
  them. Also keep in mind that getting nominated does not mean all the nominations are with you.
  Nominators can choose up to 16 validators.
- _My scoring doesn't update_, _I haven't been elected for a while_? Sometimes it’s best to give
  things time to resolve; if they don't, leave a message in the dedicated matrix room or open an
  issue on GitHub.
- _The 1000 validators website is not up to date?_ See [these resources](#resources) for more
  up-to-date information.

:::caution

Using your due diligence in researching and using the wallets listed below would be best. For any
issues related to these wallet, reach out to their support teams directly.

:::

:::info

Explore Polkadot with a secure and user-friendly wallets listed on the
[Polkadot website](https://www.polkadot.network/ecosystem/wallets/).

:::

If you are new to blockchain technology, generally a typical blockchain network account is a
public-private key pair. Access to a private key gives full access to all the allowed transactions
on that blockchain account. It is essential to keep the private key secure.

Typically, the account keys are either stored and accessed through a browser extension or a
smartphone app (which are considered as a hot wallets as they are online), or an air-gapped device
or a hardware wallet (which are considered as cold wallets as they are offline).

:::tip Not your keys, not your tokens!

With **custodial wallets** (like accounts in centralized exchanges), another party controls your
private keys. Private keys are used to access funds in your account, so you trust the exchange that
your key will always be given to you whenever you need it. With **non-custodial wallets**, only you
can access your account's private key.

:::

To realize the multichain vision of {{ polkadot: Polkadot :polkadot }}{{ kusama: Kusama :kusama }},
it is important to have non-custodial wallets that make it convenient to interact with multiple
blockchains in {{ polkadot: Polkadot :polkadot }}{{ kusama: Kusama :kusama }} ecosystem. Below there
is a list of all non-custodial treasury-funded wallets developed by the community.

## Overview

### Browser Extensions

At a bare minimum, browser extension wallets act as key storage and management solution, allowing
you to use your accounts with apps in the Web3 space. The wallets listed below offer functionality
beyond that, allowing the featured actions to be performed directly through the extension. Some of
them also allow interaction with air-gapped wallets and hardware devices.

### Mobile Wallets

Mobile wallets are fully packaged apps that allow all the featured actions, as well as the storage
and management of your accounts, through the mobile app. Unlike browser extensions, mobile wallets
usually can’t connect to third-party web apps. Some mobile wallets provide support for hardware
wallets through Bluetooth connectivity.

:::caution \*Note about Nova wallet

There's **another** Nova wallet that is **unrelated** to the Polkadot ecosystem. Users are advised
to ensure that they use the correct Nova wallet by downloading the app from their official website:
[https://novawallet.io/](https://novawallet.io/). Before creating or restoring accounts , it is wise
to double-check the wallet website URLs through official channels (most projects have it listed on
their official social media handles).

Back in the early 2000's the internet featured read-only, static, basic web pages. The online
connected world at the time was only the beginning of virtual data, identities, and more. The
internet during this time can be viewed as its first version (Web1).

As social media platforms and online businesses began to emerge, the internet transformed into its
next iteration - the Web2. This upgraded internet, which we use today, features dynamic, interactive
web pages, where users can read and write information and publish their own for others to see.
However, this version of the web comes with downsides, dealing with data control, privacy issues,
and the consequences of trusting centralized entities storing our data on their servers. This is
where Web3 comes into the picture.

Web3 is transforming applications hosted on centralized infrastructure into decentralized
applications (dApps) powered by trust-free blockchain protocols. The goal is to transform the
internet into a decentralized web, where users control their data and identity in a trust-free
environment. The Web3 movement aims to remove intermediaries and build trustless infrastructure.
Web3 is an interactive and collaborative web where users can read, write, and **own** data.

In web3, ownership is achieved and validated through cryptography. Each user has a digital identity
bound to a set of cryptographic keys usually based on the public key cryptographic scheme, i.e., the
famous **public and private key pair**.

Unlike Web2 which is driven by email IDs, phone numbers, and passwords, users onboarding to Web3
just need to generate a key pair. The public key can be the identity that can be shared with anybody
to send you messages or assets, while the private key is used to access your account, sign messages,
transfer funds, edit identity details, etc. [Keeping your private key secure](./scams.md) is
essential to avoid identity theft or consequent loss of funds. Currently, scams are one of the main
factors hindering web3 adoption. No legitimate person or entity will ever ask you to share your
private key, and those who attempt to do so are likely trying to steal your digital identity and
anything you own related to it.

To mitigate risks of key mismanagement (for **non-custodial** accounts, i.e. when you have custody
of your keys) there are [account abstraction](../learn/learn-account-abstraction.md) solutions that
separate the key management from the user experience. To mitigate key hacks, there are cold wallet
solutions where the private key is generated and stored on dedicated devices with secure elements
that are not exposed to the internet (see [Ledger](./ledger.md)), or dedicated applications that can
be installed on air-gapped devices such as phones (see [Polkadot Vault](./polkadot-vault.md)). For
**custodial** accounts, you trust third parties to manage your keys and give you access whenever
needed.

To summarize, data ownership comes from the fact that any message you sign with your private key
comes from your digital identity, and the signature proof can be cryptographically verified. Unless
someone else stole your keys, you and only you are held accountable for signing the messages and are
responsible for the information on your account. Transferring an [NFT](./learn-nft-index) between
two accounts is essentially a transfer of ownership.

## Trustless Environment

Cryptography also brings the possibility of building a trustless environment where we do not have to
trust third parties, or have any relationship between the sender and receiver of a message. We do
not need to trust centralized entities since we can verify who wrote the message and who owns what
just by using cryptography. Trust is embedded in the code. Well-audited and reviewed code ultimately
provides a solid, trustless environment.

## Data Immutability

But what if the data we own can be easily modified or tampered with after they have been signed and
stored?

Here is where **blockchain** technology plays an important role. Blockchain networks comprise of
distributed state machines where increments of data are stored within blocks that build on each
other using hash functions. For example, the hash of block `N + 1` contains data of that block
together with the hash of the previous block `N`. This creates the situation where if you modify the
content of block `N` you will change the hash of block `N + 1`, `N + 2`, etc. essentially breaking
the chain. Although it can be possible to add an invalid block (a block with invalid transactions)
or censor certain transactions, if the blockchain network is nor sufficiently decentralized. In
decentralized proof-of-stake blockchains like
{{ polkadot: Polkadot :polkadot }}{{ kusama: Kusama :kusama }} such attacks are financially
expensive, and attempting to do it can get you
[slashed](../learn/learn-staking-advanced.md#slashing).

So, with blockchain as a means of storing data and transactions permanently without an option to
modify them, we can ensure what we cryptographically sign with our digital identity is set in stone
digitally.

## Data Retrievability

But what if our data are stored in a blockchain, but that blockchain is run on a centralized server
or by different computers belonging to the same operator?

That server or those computers can be easily shut down, the blockchain can be stopped from running
and its data wiped out. This can be achieved from the inside by the malicious network participants
or from the outside by regulatory rules and other forces. Though blockchain offers immutability,
there would be little sense in using a centralized blockchain to prove ownership as it can possibly
cease to exist in the future.

Data retrievability is dependent on how resilient the blockchain is. Resiliency is achieved through
elements such as decentralization, economic incentives, and on-chain governance to ensure the
network can sustain on its own.

:::info Data Retrievability vs. Data Availability

Data **retrievability** is the ability of nodes to retrieve historical information from the
blockchain. Historical data is not needed to verify new blocks; it is only required for synching
full nodes from the Genesis block or serving specific historical requests.

Data **availability** assures full nodes can access and verify the full transactions associated with
a specific block. It does not necessarily imply that the data is accessible forever. For more
information about data availability on Polkadot, see the
[dedicated section on the parachain protocol page](../learn/learn-parachains-protocol.md#availability-and-validity-anv-protocol).

### Decentralization

Having multiple nodes belonging to numerous independent identities increases network resiliency and
thus data retrievability.

Blockchain is a state machine, and consensus must be achieved on every single state transition by
every node on the blockchain network. In Proof of Work (PoW) based blockchains, which let any node
in the network produce a block, consensus is achieved probabilistically by building on the longest
chain (at the cost of energy-intensive computations). Proof of Stake (PoS) based blockchains like
Polkadot enable deterministic consensus by allowing only a limited number of privileged nodes to
produce blocks. A PoW blockchain can be considered centralized if a single entity can capture 51% of
network nodes. Similarly, a PoS blockchain can be considered centralized if a single entity controls
more than one-third of nodes, as a two-thirds majority is required to arrive at a deterministic
consensus. Different blockchains have different levels of decentralization.

Nowadays, most of the nodes cannot be run on consumer-grade hardware. Node running equipment is
typically rented through service providers. Resiliency is also achieved by ensuring nodes run on as
many different providers as possible and avoiding a significant share of the nodes being run under
the same provider in the same geographic region. A legislation change or a natural disaster could
impact a considerable fraction of the nodes and potentially stop the network.
{{ polkadot: Pokadot :polkadot }}{{ kusama: Kusama :kusama }} level of decentralization can be
explored through the [Polkawatch app](https://polkawatch.app/).

The [One Thousand Validator Programme](./thousand-validators.md) aims to incentivize the creation of
new validator nodes to increase the level of node decentralization.

### Decentralized Storage

[Blockspace](./glossary/#blockspace) is limited and valuable. Not all data we have can be stored on
the blockchain. Large files like pictures, music, movies, etc., typically will never be held on the
blockchain. But where can we stored those files? To stick to the web3 vision, we need a resilient
and decentralized storage solution.

The most important thing is that the proof of ownership is stored on the blockchain through the
hashes of data and metadata. The files are uploaded on decentralized storage networks hosting
protocols like [IPFS](https://ipfs.tech/).

### Stake Allocation

In Proof-of-Stake blockchains, security is dictated by how much stake is locked on-chain (financial
security). In a decentralized network, you want to ensure that the difficulty level for a financial
attack to happen is equally difficult across all nodes.
{{ polkadot: Polkadot :polkadot }}{{ kusama: Kusama :kusama }}'s
[election algorithm](../learn/learn-phragmen.md) makes sure that the stake is maximized across all
active validators, and the variance in stake across validators is minimized as much as possible.

### Economic Incentives

Strong incentives are essential to incentivize network participants to run nodes and secure the
network. Strong incentives are possible because blockchain is a trustless system where there are no
intermediaries between who sends a message and who receives it. Such incentives, coupled with
punishment for bad behavior, ensure that most of the participants make the interest of the network
and work together to improve it.

But from where are those incentives coming from? Polkadot's native token
[DOT is inflationary](../learn/learn-inflation.md). Inflation is used to pay validators for running
nodes and reward nominators for providing the necessary stake to secure the network. Depending on
the staking rate, part of the inflation is diverted to the treasury.

### Governance and Treasury

In {{ polkadot: Polkadot :polkadot }}{{ kusama: Kusama :kusama }} an on-chain
[treasury](../learn/learn-polkadot-opengov-treasury.md) together with an
[open governance](../learn/learn-polkadot-opengov.md) model allow to access funds in a fully
decentralized manner without any bank transaction whatsoever. This opens up the possibility to come
to a decision through on-chain voting mechanism, promoting a sense of community and creating an
independent socio-economical environment.

## Decentralized Access Points

But what if we have data we own stored on a resilient blockchain, but the only way to access the
blockchain is through an RPC server? Whoever is behind the server or an attacker could present us
data that is not the truth. How can we trustlessly verify that the data is true?

Here is where light clients play a key role. Light clients are clients that can sit on a web browser
and can fetch data directly from blockchain. The figure below shows the architectural difference
between web2 and web3 applications.

![light-clients](../assets/light-clients.png)

In web2 applications, data are stored on a centralized server, while in web3 applications, data (or
better data proofs) are stored on the blockchain. With light clients, it is possible to access
blockchain data through a full node and verify the validity of such data. They efficiently
synchronize (_warp sync_ in case of Polkadot) with a full node to obtain (Merkle Root) commitment of
the latest chain state, and hence can trustlessly verify any response by full node against the
commitment. In this way, we can always verify that the data we see is the truth, which is done
automatically by the light client. Polkadot has a browser-embedded light client
[Substrate connect](../build/build-light-clients.md) that uses the
[smoldot](https://github.com/smol-dot/smoldot) codebase. Most web3 applications today access
blockchain data through a centralized RPC server.

## Interoperability

The Web3 landscape's expansion into a multi-layered ecosystem highlights the need for
interoperability. Blockchains compete and differentiate themselves based on decentralization,
throughput, and specific use case focus. Some aim for a single high-performance base-layer
blockchain, while others focus on decentralization through layer-2 networks. With such diverse
approaches, it's crucial for distinct on-chain environments to interoperate, especially for
developers building cross-chain applications and traditional systems interacting with multiple
blockchains.

Various cross-chain interactions are employed to achieve interoperability, including token swaps,
token bridges, native payments, contract calls, and programmable token bridges. Each mechanism
serves specific functions, such as facilitating the exchange of tokens between different blockchains
or enabling smart contract interactions across chains. Other interoperability solutions validate the
state of a source blockchain and relay transactions to the destination blockchain, which is
essential for completing cross-chain interactions.

Interoperability between chains having different consensus has been a challenging task. Most of
hacks have exploited vulnerabilities in interoperability protocols. Polkadot provides secure
interoperability through [XCM](../learn/learn-xcm.md) and [XCMP](../learn/learn-xcm-transport.md) to
all blockchains attached to it. For more information, see the [Polkadot 1.0 page](./polkadot-v1.md)
and
[the section about XCM and Accords in Polkadot Direction page](./polkadot-direction.md#xcm-and-accords).
