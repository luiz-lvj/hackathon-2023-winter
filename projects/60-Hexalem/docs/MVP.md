# MVP & Reference implementation in C#

A reference implementation in C# allows us to mock the backend and start simultanously to work on the frontend.

### Structured Outline of Functions for Hexalem Single Player MVP

#### 1. **Initialization Module**
   - **InitializeGame**: Set up the initial state of the game, including the hexagonal grid and starting resources.
