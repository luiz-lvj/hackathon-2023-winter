# Net

The `net` folder contains:
- Shared logic (`Engine`), that is then used by **Unity UI** and others.
- Automated tests.
- `WebAPI`, that was initially used for quick scaffolding.
- `NetApiExt`, which is an automatically generated c# project by Substrate.Net.Toolchain, for communication with the Substrate Node.
- `Integration`, that combines `Engine` and `NetApiExt`.
- `Bot`, that implements a simple AI to play against

Basically, you can find a bunch logic here, that is hidden from the end-user. This logic is then used in the **Unity UI**.

For a guide on how to start the local Hexalem Substrate Node, please refer to the [Substrate node readme](https://github.com/SubstrateGaming/hackathon-2023-winter/tree/main/projects/36-Hexalem/src/substrate/README.md).
- To start the tests, just click on the 3 green triangles.
